<p>At the end of June, I said this anime watching had gotten out of hand.
After <a href="/anime-2019/h1/">24 shows and 5 movies</a>, I was ready for a break.</p>
<p>I made it into the middle of August before I watched another show.
So pretty good restraint I would say.</p>
<p>The shows of second half of 2019, in watch order:</p>
<ul><li>AnoHana</li><li>Rising of the Shield Hero</li><li>Goblin Slayer</li><li>The Devil is a Part-Timer!</li><li>Ouran High School Host Club</li><li>Gabriel DropOut!</li><li>Demon Slayer</li><li>Is it wrong to pick up girls in a dungeon? 2</li><li>Angel Beats!</li><li>Akame ga Kill!</li><li>Suzumiya Haruhi no Yuuutsu</li><li>Ms. Vampire who lives in my neighborhood.</li><li>Wotakoi: Love is Hard for Otaku</li><li>Lupin the Third; The Woman Called Fujiko Mine</li><li>Ping Pong The Animation</li><li>Steins;Gate</li><li>Dr. Stone</li><li>Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica</li><li>Noragami</li><li>Noragami Aragoto</li><li>Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu</li><li>Descending Stories: Showa Genroku Rakugo Shinju </li></ul><p>And the movies:</p>
<ul><li>Is It Wrong to Try to Pick Up Girls in a Dungeon?: Arrow of the Orion</li><li>In this corner of the world</li><li>Princess Mononoke</li><li>Pokemon 4Ever</li><li>AnoHana</li><li>Fullmetal Alchemist the Movie: Conqueror of Shamballa</li><li>Fullmetal Alchemist: The Sacred Star of Milos</li><li>Black Fox</li><li>Suzumiya Haruhi no Shoushitsu</li><li>Fate/Stay night: Heaven’s feel Part 2</li><li>Pokémon the Movie: I Choose You!</li></ul><p>That's 22 shows and 11 movies.
Approximately on pace with the first half of the year despite that month and a half of break.</p>
<h2>Ranking and review</h2>
<h3>Most re-watch-able</h3>
<p>Frankly, there has not been a show or movie that I've come back and fully watched (yet).
I have gone back to watch the best parts of Rising of the Shield Hero, Akame ga Kill!, and Goblin Slayer.
However, I feel like to win in this category, the <em>entire</em> thing needs to be re-watchable.</p>
<p>The show I feel most confident I'll be hitting up again is The Devil is a Part-Timer!
Lots of fun moments in each episode.</p>
<h3>Most emotional</h3>
<p>I probably shouldn't keep judging these by how much these make me cry.</p>
<p>At the end of Descending Stories: Showa Genroku Rakugo Shinju, I was ready to get soaked.
You watch these characters over the course of their whole lives.
You get attached to there failures, flaws, and regret.
But it all went so fast, and I got blindsided by the feels train.</p>
<p>I found the movie to be complete tedium, but AnoHana (the show) did deliver on the feels it had promised.</p>
<h3>Most fun</h3>
<p>Going through Dr. Stone, every next episode I thought, &quot;Ah, shit. What's Senku cooking up for us today?&quot;
He's not just blowing your mind, the entire cast is right there with you.</p>
<p>Steins;Gate was also carried by its main character.
I still don't know if this guy had any idea what was going on, but his vocabulary was certainly entertaining.
While I came into this anticipating a lot more, the show was enjoyable for sure.</p>
<h3>Best concept</h3>
<p>Dr. Stone has a great execution of a goal: teach some science.
It is so much more than that though.</p>
<p>Take Calls at Work, another interesting way to approach teaching, where cells in the body are personified to demonstrate their roles and their perceptions of what's going on in and outside the body.
It's got a limited set of themes: learn this cell (which is the primary goal), cells don't understand the macro events (a scrapped knee is the world tearing open), and shipping the two main character cells.</p>
<p>Dr. Stone offers a much richer story surrounding the science.</p>
<p>The Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu series demonstrated an art form I did not even know existed.
Main story aside, the culture captured in these episodes I am glad were exposed to me.</p>
<p>Despite not liking the show and hating Haruhi as a character, Suzumiya Haruhi no Yuuutsu did present an interesting world.
For those who sometimes pause and think &quot;does the world revolve around me?&quot; this is a must watch.</p>
<h3>Best soundtrack</h3>
<p>Since I finished Akame ga Kill! I've been cycling through the music at least once a week.</p>
<p>Rising of the Shield Hero wins opening themes with some high energy jams.
Goblin Slayer's music does a great job of matching and setting the tone of the show.</p>
<h3>Best girl</h3>
<p>Noragami's Hiyori is a goof and despite being the mostly only human character manages to be the glue holding the show together.
She's also just so sweet and gives so much of herself.</p>
<p>Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica's Homura I'd also like to praise here.
However, the show was spoiled for me so I'm just not gonna get into this one for your sake.</p>
