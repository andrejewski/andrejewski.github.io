                I got eye surgery this year. I learned a lot about eye things
                going through the process and wanted to share. If you've been
                considering eye surgery or have
                <em>absolutely not</em> considered getting eye surgery, this
                article may be for you.

                Eyes make me very uncomfortable. I had a panic attack at the eye
                exam where I was prescribed glasses. So if you also have an
                aversion to eye things, you're in good company. I will 100%
                neglect to talk about the anatomy bits, I'll only talk about the
                procedure and experience as a non-medical expert.
              </p>
              <p>
                Now I will say, in case you haven't gathered from me making an
                article about eyes, my eye surgery experience has made me less
                scared of eye things overall. I am still in the &quot;let's
                not&quot; camp of eyeball discussion, but the surgery is easier
                to discuss.

              </h1>
              <p>Only some people qualify for corrective eye surgery:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    Your eyes need to have fully developed and stopped growing
                    which usually means you are in your twenties at least.
                    Having eye exams over a period of time is a requirement to
                    prove this out. For example, I had my first eye exam where I
                    got glasses. Four years later I got another eye exam and my
                    prescription had not changed. Very fortunately, this was
                    sufficient for me to be eligible for surgery.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    Your eyes can't have too strong of a prescription, and
                    astigmatism may also rule you out depending on severity.
                    Also the way the common surgeries work is by layering away
                    your eye. Nearsightedness can be corrected by rounding down
                    the eye to be more spherical but farsightedness actually
                    needs more eye added, and I don't know much about options
                    there. In any case, don't be discouraged. Get an opinion
                    from your eye examiner about your eligibility. In my case,
                    my prescription had been fairly minor with no astigmatism.
                  </p>
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                There is some time sensitivity to the eye exam and the surgery
                as in my case I only had about a month between exam and surgery
                to commit otherwise the exam needed to be conducted again.
                Luckily, the eye surgeon I opted for did a consultation / exam
                the morning of the surgery, but had I chosen another surgeon I
                would have had to keep that in mind.

                <a href="#choosing-a-surgery">Choosing a surgery</a>
              </h1>
              <p>
                I opted for Photorefractive keratectomy, which everyone just
                calls PRK. The most common procedure is LASIK, and PRK is a
                sister procedure: same cost, roughly the same outcomes, similar
                enough procedure, and similar eligibility requirements.
              </p>
              <p>
                There are also other eye surgeries for later in life like for
                cataracts. The only other common surgery for the 20-30s age
                group is MonoVision. No acronym. The MonoVision procedure is for
                people with severe prescription differences between eyes. For
                example, one eye is nearsighted and the other farsighted.
                MonoVision adjusts the eyes to have each play to their strength.
                You'll be able to see well far out of one eye, and see well at
                short distances using the other. This one has disadvantages for
                depth perception and takes getting used to post-surgery.
              </p>
              <p>
                Anyhoo, I was eligible for either LASIK or PRK. Here are the
                pros and cons:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    LASIK wins hella in the recovery time area. With LASIK, you
                    can be recovered and back to life in 2-3 days. PRK has a
                    mandatory week of recovery time, plus about another 1-2
                    months until the eye is fully back to normal. Not everyone
                    has the luxury to take a week off work to heal, and trust me
                    you won't be doing anything but recovering that week after
                    PRK.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    PRK wins in simplicity of procedure. If you are concerned
                    about the safety of eye surgery, you will be happy to know
                    PRK only involves a single laser. Whereas LASIK involves
                    two. I'll discuss the PRK surgery experience below.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    PRK, unlike LASIK, does not create an incision/flap in your
                    eye which will never fully heal. LASIK involves creating a
                    flap (laser 1) and then correcting underneath the flap
                    (laser 2). The flap does heal over time, especially on the
                    surface of the eye, but never fully. I didn't want to live
                    knowing I had flaps in both eyes the rest of my life. After
                    a year of healing it makes no practical difference, but to
                    me it was about the principle of it.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    LASIK recovery hurts way less than PRK. I only got PRK but
                    just talking with LASIK patients, the pain and duration of
                    pain is easily 5x. With PRK, the laser does way more work of
                    your eye and thus the eye is much more irritated.
                  </p>
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                I paid $5.1k for surgery on both eyes. This included some
                lifetime guarantee of touch-ups if I needed them and the
                post-surgery examinations. Without those things, I was quoted
                $4.4k by another surgeon. I opted for the more expensive package
                deal so I didn't have to sort any more logistics out.
              </p>
              <p>
                I think either surgery will be fine for most people. I have a
                friend who had done a now defunct procedure other than LASIK, so
                I happen to be aware of the existence of other options for many,
                many years leading up to the surgery. If the flap doesn't bother
                you, LASIK is probably the better choice.
              </p>

              </h1>
              <p>
                I opted to have my consultation and surgery on the same day, but
                you can separate them. I thought it was better to pack them back
                to back as opposed to having to make two trips.
              </p>
              <p>
                Even before surgery, I 100% recommend meal prepping. Have meals
                ready to go for the next few days (LASIK) or week (PRK). You'll
                also need a surgery buddy to get you too and from the surgery.
                You might not be able to even look at your phone to call in a
                ride-share service after the surgery.
              </p>
              <p>
                The consultation is similar to an eye exam, just without much
                talking and more types of tests/scans. Notably for me was the
                air pressure test and the retinal scans. I got unlucky and
                needed retinal scanned about fivesâ€“this blinded me more than
                anything going on in the actual surgery.
              </p>
              <p>
                I was prescribed Gabapentin and took a dose after the
                consultation. Gabapentin chills you out a bit as an anti-anxiety
                drug. (Vets also prescribe it for dogs who are anxious to fly in
                places I would later find out.) Before the surgery I was also
                given Valium. I was chilling with the Gabapentin but the Valium
                took it up a few notches. You can decline the Valium if you
                want, but I think it helped me a lot to sit through the surgery.
              </p>
              <p>
                Your eyes are also numbed for the surgery itself. This was chill
                as the assistant administers the drops for you. The numbing is
                pretty darn effective. After the surgery, my friend and I got
                lunch. It was only when I got back to my place an hour after
                surgery that the effects of the drugs and numbing wore off.
              </p>
              <p>
                They put you in a fully reclined chair for the surgery. The
                chair is pretty much like a dentist chair. They hold your
                eyelids open so you don't need to worry about closing your eyes:
                you couldn't if you tried. They also give you a light source to
                stare at while the surgery is happening. The light (1) gave me
                something to do, and (2) helped keep me focused straight ahead.
              </p>
              <p>
                Both LASIK and PRK are quick. PRK was about two minutes per eye,
                but with the Valium hitting it felt even shorter. The laser
                doesn't hurt at all, but you can hear it activate and whizz
                while it's doing its thing. I was warned about the smell of the
                laser burning your eyeball. I can confirm I did catch a whiff!
                It wasn't anything special if you've ever burnt hair in a hair
                dryer.
              </p>
              <p>
                In those minutes of surgery, the experience felt like a car wash
                more than anything. The assistants are putting so much solution
                in your eyes to clean away whatever.
              </p>
              <p>
                Once each eye is finished, they place a contact bandage atop the
                eye to make sure nothing gets in there while it is healing. I
                never did regular contacts so I don't have a point of reference,
                but these contacts felt secure, and thick: I could feel them
                ever so slightly with each blink.
              </p>
              <p>
                Once the PRK surgery was complete, the surgeon shook my hand and
                was basically like, &quot;Alright get out of here before it
                starts hurting.&quot; They gave me a to-go bag of various drops
                and written instructions for the next few weeks.
              </p>

              </h1>
              <p>
                As I said, I arrived home and the drugs and numbing has trailed
                off. The battle began.
              </p>
              <p>
                I'd mentioned the meal prep trick already and here's another
                trick: memorize the post surgery instructions before the
                surgery. I say this because written instructions are useless to
                someone who cannot see. (I gave this feedback to the surgeon.)
              </p>
              <p>
                While it doesn't happen to everybody, the pain caused my eyes to
                be welded shut for a time. I could sneak very quick glances like
                a photo-only camera, otherwise I was walking around blind. When
                my eyes open I was super light sensitive so I lived mostly in
                the dark. It was good I had read the instructions many times
                over waiting for the surgery to begin, otherwise that would have
                been hectic.
              </p>
              <p>
                Another pro-tip: you'll be given three bottles of eye drops
                you'll need using the day of surgery. Make sure to open them
                before the surgery, or get someone else to open these bottles
                for you for the first time. I'd not been so angry in so long as
                I was trying to open a little tiny bottle completely blind and
                under a great deal of pain.
              </p>
              <p>The three bottles of eye drops:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Numbing drops, like the ones from surgery</li>
                <li>Prednisolone, to deal with inflammation</li>
                <li>Artificial tears, to combat dry eye</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                In the first few days, I was spamming the numbing and
                inflammation drops to abide the pain. The numbing drops only are
                meant to last three days so you have to be a bit conservative.
                Let the pain guide you to a proper dosage I say.
              </p>
              <p>
                Our good friend Gabapentin will also be taken in the first few
                days in the mornings. I recommend Daft Punk's
                <em>Random Access Memories</em> album while under the influence
                and laying in bed.
              </p>
              <p>
                The first and second days are just pure, constant pain. I had
                been warned the feeling is like scraping your eye on the
                sidewalk and it's not as bad as that, but not by much. Notably,
                the pain is so constant I did not sleep more than 15 minutes
                consecutively the first night. You're also uncontrollably
                crying. It's the natural thing eyes do when they believe they've
                just been scrapped on the pavement.
              </p>
              <p>
                The second and third days, the pain begins to taper off. A new
                challenger approaches: you've run out of eyes. I didn't know if
                I could run out of tears. My whole life they seemed readily
                available, but turns out after two nonstop days of crying my
                tank was empty. This became the game the next few days: add
                moisture to your eyes before dry eye gets you.
              </p>
              <p>
                I ran a humidifier in my bedroom and kept it sealed the best I
                could. The artificial tears become important in this phase and I
                also spammed them for a bit, every hour or so.
              </p>
              <p>
                By day four, the pain was controlled well enough I could start
                to alleviate the third and final boss: boredom. There's
                literally nothing to do except try to sleep through the pain or
                listen to music the first few days. With the pain decreasing, I
                took some time to make phone calls to people I'd not spoken to
                in a while. I was also able to keep my eyes open for longer, but
                preferred not to dry them out that way.
              </p>
              <p>
                Day six, the pain is mostly gone. I was settled into my eye drop
                schedule and no longer riffing it with additional drops. More
                importantly, this was the day I went back to the surgeon to get
                the contact bandages removed. That was a relief. The small
                snagging it had been doing on my eyelid made me uncomfortable.
                Without the contacts, my eyelid movements were buttery smooth;
                more than I ever felt they were prior.
              </p>
              <p>
                The outer part of the eye, its protective coating, heals more
                quickly than the parts that were corrected with the laser. So
                while I no longer had safety contacts, I still had much healing
                to do. I continued the eye drops until they ran out, which was
                about a full week and a half after the surgery in my case.
              </p>
              <p>
                As the healing process continues, the pain is gone but I was
                still quite sensitive to lights and computer screens for a good
                two weeks. In this time my eyes would also have good days and
                bad days in terms of how much strain they could bear.
              </p>
              <p>
                Everyday felt as if my eyes had batteries which indicated just
                how much eye strain they could handle before shutting down. I
                found taking naps gave me a few extra hours in normal light.
                Week over week, the eye strain limit increased until by about
                five weeks in I stopped noticing anything abnormal.

                About a month after the surgery is the final post-operation
                exam. This is just a regular eye test to confirm your vision is
                improved, which mine definitely was. Compared to the other two
                visits, this one is anti-climatic. You're just done. There's
                still more healing that happens over the next few months, but I
                didn't notice any more changes after two months out.
              </p>
              <p>
                The PRK recovery time is quite an experience. You can see why
                LASIK being only 2-3 days of healing definitely gives it a
                competitive edge. However, after two months, I was really quite
                happy with PRK. My heart sings, &quot;no flap, no flap&quot; and
                the pain will become a distant memory over time.

                I'm happy with my corrective eye surgery experience. It wasn't
                without a whole bunch of pain certainly. However, having my eyes
                back in action has been great in a lot of ways.

                  Glasses are heavy. My lenses weren't even that thick or
                  anything but it is nice not having to wear anything anymore.
                </li>
                <li>
                  My eyes can feel the wind. Glasses act like goggles and it is
                  nice feeling the breeze with my full face again.
                </li>
                <li>
                  So so so much time saved not hunting for where I put my
                  glasses. When I leave my place I don't need to backtrack
                  because I lost my glasses ever again!
                </li>
                <li>
                  Night driving is much better. I had whatever the anti-glare
                  additive is in my glasses but nothing beats no glare at all.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Did I mention I can see better? At my last eye exam I was told
                  that when looking with both eyes I'm seeing even better than
                  20/20; that's crazy.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                I hope writing about my experience has given you some insight
                into the whole process, gave you some actionable advice, or at
                least entertained you with my suffering.

                BUT, if it didn't. Don't worry, the best part of eye surgery
                will now be revealed: I got it on camera. Yes boys and girls,
                strap in as we watch my eye surgery: (watch with sound on for
                the full experience)
