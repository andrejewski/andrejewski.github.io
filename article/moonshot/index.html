              <p>Hello my peers,</p>
              <p>
                For those of you who recently joined this committee, my name is
                Lucas Grine. I joined this group almost a decade ago. In a world
                so politically charged, what I love most in life, besides my
                family of course, is this committee and our pursuits to improve
                the world through science. I welcome you all and expect nothing
                but great things!
              </p>
              <p>
                For months, I have been working on an ambitious project. Unlike
                my previous research and experiments, this project involves
                pointing a finger at Science itself and taking a look at its
                future. I am happy to say the project has completed and the
                future is quite bright for humanity.
              </p>
              <p>
                The advancement of technology and science has been on a decline
                for decades. Society has written checks it cannot cash: climate
                change, pollution, exhaustion of natural resources. We as a
                species always bet on the next generation to finally fix the
                issues and as a result have left ourselves a deeper and deeper
                hole to crawl out from each time. All the while we face greater
                challenges in the science itself to get a sliver of progress for
                us to savor despite our inevitable collapse.
              </p>
              <p>
                Science has served us well for a few centuries: first world
                societies live in unprecedented luxury due to its advances.
              </p>
              <p>
                However, we now need a different approach to solving our
                problems and unravelling the nature of the universe. What is the
                probability that we can succeed without science? Ladies and
                gentlemen of the committee, I must tell you that the probability
                is not zero.
              </p>
              <p>
                With this very idea in mind, I would like to introduce Jerome
                &quot;Wish&quot; Miles, the luckiest known person alive.
              </p>
              <p>
                We believe this man possesses the innate ability to push
                humanity forward and succeed where science could not. We have
                entered a new period of civilization in which we no longer need
                theories, laws, or even explanations for the underpinnings of
                our reality to serve as our foundations. These circumstances
                demand intuition and guidance that defy all probability, and
                reason I assure you.
              </p>
              <p>
                I must insist this document is genuine. Without a doubt, many of
                you must read this with the same skepticism I once held nearest
                to my heart. Before I state the results of my project, I would
                like to articulate Jerome's pedigree. (He insists to be called
                simply Jerome.)
              </p>
              <p>
                Some of you have already heard of Jerome's upbringing as it
                caused quite a legal stir many years ago. Jerome was born on a
                nonstop flight from Ottawa to Philadelphia. The delivery was a
                complete success due to there being, not one, but seven doctors
                on the plane returning to the states from a seminar. The time of
                birth was 2:22, which isn't in itself remarkable. What is
                remarkable and what caused such a ruckus: days after the plane
                landed Canadian and American authorities needed to decide the
                child's citizenship.
              </p>
              <p>
                After a lengthy and public investigation, both countries
                concluded by examining the black box of the plane that on the
                day of the flight there was no mistaking that the aircraft
                crossed over the border at exactly 2:22. Jerome was the first
                child born to receive both Canadian and American citizenship
                despite both of his parents being from neither country but
                instead the Caribbean. This decision and the publicity of it
                also allowed the parents to also gain citizenship and remain in
                the states where they live to this day.

                Now, I know some of you are not versed in international or
                constitutional law of either of these countries. Myself, experts
                in these fields, and even Jerome himself will tell you this
                outcome makes &quot;absolutely no fucking sense.&quot; By every
                possible measure of legal precedent this is not how the law has
                ever or ever will work. Beyond this miracle of legal maneuvering
                in those moments, this anomaly still baffles experts to this
                day. Despite all of this and numerous attempts to overturn
                within both countries, the decision stands.
              </p>
              <p>
                This is but one instance of Jerome overcoming not a single
                impossibility but multiple impossibilities stemming from that
                first incredible stroke of luck.
              </p>
              <p>
                These anecdotes continue to leave me in awe even as I share them
                here now, but they're certainly compelling; scarily so. One more
                example from Jerome's life involves the lottery not
                surprisingly. Here especially, please keep this document
                confidential, as the sensitive nature of this story has not been
                disclosed broadly.
              </p>
              <p>
                If anyone of you were foolish and happened to participate
                regularly in lottery drawings at the turn of the decade you may
                have noticed an irregularity to say the least. Even before then,
                Jerome's parents had discovered his ability and wasted no time
                collecting lottery winnings. They operated cautiously, winning a
                total of 12 times, only collecting the winnings for 4, each just
                before the time limit to collect to attract the least attention.
                This and other schemes had Jerome's family, here and in the
                Caribbean, living in luxury.
              </p>
              <p>
                These later irregularities are on a much greater scale. With
                Jerome, coming of age with altruism on the brain, decided to
                share his luck with the world. Jerome started an online forum
                where we would give other people numbers to play. People would
                somehow stumble upon the forum, see the wake of Jerome's luck in
                the form of people asking for more and more sequences, and make
                a request themselves. Jerome privately gave everyone who asked a
                number. This number proved not to even need to be played the
                same day or week it was received, whenever it was played it
                would work.
              </p>
              <p>
                This influx of winners did not destroy the lottery system since
                taxes were still being taken out. Lottery officials did get
                involved and traced the numbers back to Jerome but couldn't find
                any foul play. For the months Jerome distributed these numbers,
                various jackpots across the country and even abroad did not grow
                beyond their initial pots since someone won every drawing. These
                irregularities subsided, not because of any backlash from the
                public or the government, but because Jerome found a new way to
                help people that he preferred over the forum.
              </p>
              <p>
                So why then is this confidential? How could one person enabling
                hundreds of people to consistently win lotteries all over the
                global not already be common knowledge? No seriously, like how
                the fuck, honestly. Jerome did absolutely nothing to hide his
                identity (his username was JeromeMiles222) and the forum to this
                day is accessible and all the content is there. When he stopped,
                yes there were unanswered comments but this completely escaped
                and continues to escape the press.
              </p>
              <p>
                I hope I've made a fair point here. In fact, nothing above is
                confidential. Go ahead and tell the world. Jerome has luck so
                other worldly that he is, in my opinion, absolutely untouchable.
                This is what it means to be the luckiest person alive, to defy
                all probability. This realization has made me question
                everything...
              </p>
              <p>
                With this framing, I believe we have proven our premise's
                initial legitimacy. I think we can now share the results of our
                project.
              </p>
              <p>
                When we began, I asked Jerome to read the &quot;List of unsolved
                problems in physics&quot; from Wikipedia. Jerome has no formal
                scientific education, he admitted most of the topics were
                completely foreign to him. Despite this, having read all the
                questions, Jerome took a shot at solving them all at once.
              </p>
              <p>
                Now, I personally hope, despite Jerome's abilities, that the
                groundwork centuries of scientific research had paved the way
                for, putting understandable questions to form, was not in vain.
                However, given that his first guess has so far proven to be the
                most accurate depiction of our reality, I have my doubts.
              </p>
              <p>The premise of Jerome's theory is such:</p>
              <p>
                Imagine a line, cut it in half with one dimension (a dot).
                Imagine a plane, cut it in half with a line. Imagine a three
                dimensional space, cut it in half with a plane. You can go on
                indefinitely, adding yet another dimension yet still being able
                to divide a whole in half. What if everything were predicated
                upon two variances: the number of different dimensions at play
                and how an infinite space was cut from it.
              </p>
              <p>
                Could matter represent the places between the cuts and what we
                perceive as time be a derivative of that give and take of
                regions in the infinite whole? The &quot;universe&quot; we
                occupy would then be dictated by the highest number of
                dimensions of intersecting cuts that form it. The increase in
                the size of our universe would correlate to the shifting of
                their boundaries. What we &quot;take&quot; from the whole
                expands our universe, this rate of growth would serve as a
                measure of time.
              </p>
              <p>
                Please take a moment to absorb this. This is not the first time
                that the theory our reality was a local optimum of a larger
                orchestration has been proposed. However the framing here has
                the uncanny ability to serve to describe any phenomena that has
                ever been proved by our previous standards of observation if
                cast through this lens. For months I have been postulating this
                hypothesis is correct, and in theory and application it does
                seem so.
              </p>
              <p>
                I will be publishing my findings over the course of the next few
                months. Please allocate time to validating my results. If you
                have questions please either reach out to myself or Jerome.
                Here's to new foundations!
