                  Revolution</em

                by John C. Bogle. This was his final book before he passed and a
                really enjoyable one.
              </p>
              <p>
                I've been using Vanguard since 2018. I had moved on from a
                &quot;financial advisor.&quot; Vanguard had low expense ratios
                and glowing reviews. I did not know much about the company or

              <p>
                The book tells the history of Vanguard through many lenses. The
                beginning of the book tells the end to end story and later
                chapters cover certain aspects in more detail. Near the end of
                the book, Bogle makes some predictions about the industry's
                future. Lastly, he shares various personal notes, quotes, and
                advice as he knew this would be his last book.
              </p>
              <p>
                The book's main points centered around explaining how Vanguard
                came to be, and then rallying for more Vanguards in the
                industry. Bogle attributes Vanguard's success to its mutual
                company structure: investors own funds and funds own Vanguard.
                From this structure, Bogle argues all else follows.
              </p>
              <p>
                Vanguard was Bogle's rebound from a sour merger gone wrong. He
                had merged, as CEO of Wellington Management Company, with some
                more aggressive active investors who went on to shove him out.
                He made a new company to service Wellington in managing
                administrative duties.
              </p>
              <p>
                Bogle described (1) administration, (2) investment decisions,
                and (3) distribution and sales as the three pillars of a mutual
                fund company. Vanguard creatively would come to be responsible
                for all these pillars.
              </p>
              <p>
                Underpinning mutualization was creating the right incentives
                for, not the index fund in particular, but rather reducing costs
                for investors no matter the investment scheme. This reduction of
                costs was the bedrock obligation Vanguard had to their funds and
                those funds investors. The data bears this out, especially now
                many decades later, but someone not so burned by the active
                management industry may have not pursued it.
              </p>
              <p>
                That line of reasoning was enough for Bogle to drive a wedge
                through with Vanguard. Reading about how Vanguard became the
                full mutual fund company it is today, it felt a little comical.
                Vanguard's first order of business was to weasel out of being an
                administrative-only branch of Wellington. It started with
                gaining the ability to create new non-Wellington funds:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Bogle: &quot;We [Vanguard] are creating an index fund.&quot;
                </li>
                <li>
                  Wellington: &quot;No no no. You do admin, you can't make
                  investment decisions.&quot;
                </li>
                <li>
                  Bogle: &quot;An index fund is an <em>algorithm</em> you see,
                  we don't actually make any <em>decisions</em>. So this is all
                  good, yeah?&quot;
                </li>
                <li>Wellington: &quot;Uh, yeah...I guess so.&quot;</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                With the S&amp;P 500 index, Vanguard had its foot in the door of
                its own investment future. We know the index fund as this
                radical new instrument in the finance world. To Vanguard, it was
                simply a sensible means to start breaking out on its own. A
                masterful plan and lucky opportunity as it would turn out.
              </p>
              <p>Next was sales and distribution:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Bogle: &quot;We [Vanguard] are going to start selling our
                  funds directly.&quot;
                </li>
                <li>
                  Wellington: &quot;No no no. We do the sales and
                  distribution.&quot;
                </li>
                <li>
                  Bogle: &quot;Ah but you see we're offering the funds directly.
                  We won't market, if people want to buy they can.&quot;
                </li>
                <li>Wellington: &quot;Oh...I guess that's fine.&quot;</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Both of these moves fit the narrative of reducing costs for
                investors (near-zero management fees, no sales fees). They just
                also happen to coincidentally severe Vanguard's dependency on
                Wellington. These moves would play out to allow Vanguard the
                freedom to operate autonomously in all aspects over the years.
              </p>
              <p>
                Bogle later in the book asks often why there are not more
                companies like Vanguard. I think the high initial cost of
                investment limits newcomers and Vanguard sidestepped that
                leaning on to Wellington in its early days. Vanguard also held
                the innovator's advantage to pull these tricks in an industry so
                early and have Wellington so easily &quot;tricked.&quot; This
                history put Vanguard in the unique position to reach the escape
                velocity necessary to put individual investors in the driver's
                seat with its mutual structure.
              </p>
              <p>
                Bogle spent his whole life trying to steer others to the mutual
                approach. I personally don't see the stars aligning for another
                Vanguard without a similar series of events and new innovation
                to be created in the industry. Without volunteers, Bogle urged
                public policy makers to intervene and steer towards a mutual
                structure on the grounds of fiduciary responsibility to
                investors.
              </p>
              <p>
                Vanguard was a hotbed for innovation. Having each fund in
                control of its own destiny made it fairly easy to experiment.
                Bogle was candid about errors made along the way:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    Fee decreases were commonplace until investors
                    unintentionally ceded their voting rights on fee changes, as
                    Vanguard has had a history of only reducing fees. This would
                    be a lesson to always keep a guard up for giving a central
                    authority more power than intended.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    Many a time where marketing and the newest hotness won out
                    in the short term over the business fundamentals that were
                    geared for the long term.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    In active investing, it was often the case one fund manager
                    carried a fund and upon retirement the fund died with them.
                    Anything with the inability to have a long term track record
                    beating the S&amp;P was scrutinized, so that means most of
                    them.
                  </p>
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Overall, Vanguard has crushed it in the industry. &quot;Haters
                gonna hate&quot; could have easily been coined by Bogle if this
                all started in a more recent era.

              </h2>
              <p>
                I never really knew why funds closed to new investments. When I
                had first seen Wellington and Windsor funds when I was beginning
                my investment journey, I naively thought, &quot;Ah, this fund
                has a secret formula and are keeping it for themselves.&quot;
                Something gatekeeping and secretive like that.
              </p>
              <p>
                I'm sure there are other reasons to close off new investment to
                funds, but in Vanguard's case these funds were (1) actively
                managed, and (2) had so much investment the active managers felt
                they could not scale their investing approach to match demand.
                The game they were playing did or would peak and investors would
                be hit by waning returns if they pressed on.
              </p>
              <p>
                Much more reasonable and I don't feel like I'm missing out now.

                Vanguard couldn't afford all 500 companies in the S&amp;P 500 at
                first.
              </p>
              <p>
                The initial investment in the fund was only 11 million dollars.
                The fund debuted with only the top 280 companies of the index.

              </h2>
              <p>Bogle ends the book with a bunch of personal notes.</p>
              <p>
                He quotes Adam Smith's impartial observer, which resonated with
                me. Beyond doing to your neighbor what you would want done to
                you, there's this third party watching yourself and others and
                putting pressure on your character in terms of moral
                consistency.
              </p>
              <p>
                One of the things I wanted to learn in reading this book is how
                does someone become the revolutionary for the little guy like
                Bogle was. There are many remarks and thoughts on how duty to
                individual investors is paramount in an industry that doesn't
                want to hear it. He tried to convey and appeal to morality in
                these final chapters. I'm aboard the overarching ideas, but I
                did not fully grasp a secret sauce from this book like I'd
                hoped.
              </p>
              <p>
                I keep in mind history is often written by the winners and Bogle
                definitely won. The data cannot deny the outcomes but I wasn't
                compelled on the initial motivations to pursue Vanguard.
              </p>
              <p>
                Was Bogle always first and foremost an advocate for the
                individual investor? Or was he simply lucky his revenge story
                against his Wellington partners ended up so well and he spun
                into it? The connective tissue for the former is missing, and if
                it is what of it?
              </p>
              <p>
                Morality can be awoken anywhere, and that is good. In Bogle's
                case, it was great.
