              <p>
                In the distant past, the world had split in two. Humanity had
                grown beyond the exercise of war as advanced weapons would
                render both sides extinct. The concept of conflict had not
                faded. Turning to nonviolent solutions, disputes began to be
                settled in virtual reality. The first Great Virtual War was
                marketed to be and delivered a success: no deaths and a peaceful
                transition after one side toppled the other. It was a milestone
                in human history for it to have worked, and opened the door to
                absolute diplomacy. No peace lasted forever but the process of
                resolution had never looked brighter.
              </p>
              <p>
                In time, the second Great Virtual War came to be. Each side
                assembled thousands of their greatest soldiers and placed them
                into a battlefield. The scene was prehistoric, a complete
                recreation of the world as it should have looked millennia ago.
                The simulation had been greatly improved since the first war.
                The physics, environments, and violence were drastically more
                realistic and all trials received high acclaim. The war began
                and raged for weeks. Finally the second war came to an end with
                one clear victor.
              </p>
              <p>
                Days passed and the soldiers questioned why they had not been
                pulled out. Many thought the simulation had malfunctioned,
                leaving them trapped in a digital purgatory. Some believed that
                the rules of war had not been respected by the outside world and
                the simulator had been kicked aside in the actual war, left for
                time to forget. Some people killed themselves in hopes of
                escaping, leaving others to wonder if they made it out. If they
                had escaped surely they would have awoken the remaining
                soldiers. No matter the reason, the soldiers had no recourse.
                They could only survive the simulation and wait to be rescued.
              </p>
              <p>
                Months passed as the injured healed, the surrendered adapted to
                living alongside the victors, and with no sign of assistance
                from the outside world a new civilization began. Together the
                soldiers leaped through the stages of human development from
                hunter-gatherer to farming to their first city. The environment
                had new challenges for them to face, but the simulation never
                wavered in proving to be a realistic experience. It was not long
                until this new world became the only one that mattered to many
                people.
              </p>
              <p>
                After years of waiting, just as they had on the outside, two
                divided groups formed. Knowing of the war left the soldiers
                feeling intangible and meaningless. Psychologies were broken
                down, people were driven insane, and only so many people were
                strong enough to carry on, let alone embrace their situation.
                With the advent of the first new generation of children in this
                new world, the question arose whether to bury the truth of their
                origins in order to let later generations live like they could
                actually matter. Arguments turned violent and a new war was
                born.
              </p>
              <p>
                In the end, the truth was buried and those who refused to
                disavow the past were imprisoned or killed. It took only four
                generations for the simulation to become reality. The new world
                bloomed quickly. The earliest generation exhausted themselves
                articulating the best they could the advanced technologies they
                had left behind. For centuries, the motivation for life itself
                was the fulfillment of that blueprint. The blueprint was
                completed and the years continued to pass. With enough time,
                this artifact of civilization came to be appreciated only in
                scholastic and historical circles. The world piloted its own
                future.
              </p>
              <p>
                Eventually one of these simulated beings stumbled upon a relic
                made by a dissident soldier depicting the truth of the world.
                They deciphered it and felt compelled to share it with the
                world. Most people never found the truth through the noise of
                their lives. Everyone who read the truth could not embrace it as
                it had no consequence to their lives even if it were true. Most
                who did read the truth thought it was a good story.
