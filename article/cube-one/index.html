                I was watching the news last night and saw something that really
                upset me. I don't get mad too often these days so my body
                doesn't know what to do when it happens. I stayed up all night,
                kicking around in a fuss. I read more online about what I had
                seen on the news. That just made things worse. I got a couple
                hours of sleep and then I was back at it.
              </p>
              <p>
                What set me off was this report about some guy in Nebraska of
                all places had found a pitch black cube, probably a half liter
                in size and weighing maybe a pound, in his basement or
                something. The important bit is that this cube, some time after
                the guy moved it, would always return to this exact same spot in
                his basement.
              </p>
              <p>
                The guy figures this out and starts doing
                &quot;experiments,&quot; moves the cube and waits for it to come
                back into place. First thing he tries is just making sure
                whoever he's living with isn't jerking him off so he treks that
                cube out of town, all the way to Wyoming, the capital of of all
                places. He drops it off, heads home and is greeted by this cube
                sitting in his basement. It beat him home.
              </p>
              <p>
                Next the dude figures that it is supernatural but only when he's
                not looking. Classic staring contest montage: dude makes it like
                five minutes let's say without blinking while he's sitting
                across from the cube somewhere in Wyoming again. Boom, in a
                flash, it's gone. He calls home and it is back in his basement.
                Seems like a waste of gas to me, it's just gotta be not in the
                exact place, right?
              </p>
              <p>
                &quot;Okay, this is a thing,&quot; the guy says. &quot;So what
                makes this location so special that the cube always returns to
                it.&quot; I don't think cubes are aware of human constructs like
                latitude and longitude but this guy pulled on those threads for
                awhile. Nothing came out of it. The house itself wasn't special
                either. It was just built. The people constructing the house
                didn't notice apparently. I don't buy that for a second. If the
                cube had always been there, someone had to have noticed it
                coming back day after day.
              </p>
              <p>
                The guys gets some sense to stop slicing up the ozone layer with
                his dumb midnight trips to Wyoming and buys a camera. Now he's
                on about, &quot;Well the cube always returns to rest on this
                basement floor. So if I dig up a hole underneath will it return
                there instead?&quot; Like this cube's supposed to stick to the
                ground. He places the camera, then moves the cube away, and when
                it pops back into place it appears in mid air at the usual
                altitude and then falls into the little crater this guy's clawed
                out of his man cave. It keeps going, resetting itself. If he'd
                put some dots on it he'd have himself a nice auto-rolling die I
                suppose.
              </p>
              <p>
                Then the opposite test: if you put something where it's supposed
                to appear where does it go. Spoiler: it goes exactly there. From
                what his guy can tell the matter previously occupying the space
                is just gone. It's not shoved away to make room. It's just
                erased. Dude's football didn't even have time to pop, it just
                wrapped around the cube like crusts of a sandwich from a kid who
                didn't like the crusts. A fish bowl of water just lost that much
                water to be refilled with the cube. So that means the air that
                was there all those other times was just being erased too.
              </p>
              <p>
                Gotta give this guy credit: he managed to convince other people
                to give a shit about this. These days you can practically fake
                anything and with a budget, man, those magicians can script and
                wire up anything these days. But yeah, this guy found some
                scientists that were adamant about disproving the internet blog
                spam about this black cube. If the cube was real, it was
                breaking some fundamental laws. So now this cube has dozens of
                people running tests on it. Must be a crowded basement with
                everyone coming and going. Scientists are flocking from all over
                the world to this random dude's basement in Nebraska to watch
                this cube teleport back to square one day after day.

                That's basically all they know now, or at least what the news is
                reporting about it. That's the thing with &quot;science&quot;
                these days: show people something they can't explain and they
                try to suppress it until it fits their view of the world. Like
                where do these people get off, thinking of the world as anything
                but random chance and unmitigated chaos.

                So why's this news pissing me off so much? Well, I have one of
                those cubes too. It sits right under my living room couch. When
                I moved into this place the previous owner told me about this
                cube, told me to cover it up because it'd be an eyesore. I
                hadn't own a house before. I thought, &quot;Sure, everyone must
                have one of these things.&quot; You know, like a boiler or
                something. If I knew I could get famous just by filming my cube
                get back under the couch, maybe I would have.

                I feel really stupid. I've been living here like eight years. If
                there's only two of us then I had a massive head start on this.
                Now if I come out and say I also have a teleporting cube
                everyone's gonna think I'm trolling. If they do believe me then
                I'm gonna get a bunch of nerds in my house too. The news won't
                be paying top dollar for the <em>second</em> teleporting cube
                story. I won't get well known so the government will just throw
                me in a cell somewhere so I don't spill the beans.
              </p>
              <p>
                I'm still conflicted though because maybe they run all the tests
                on my cube and my cube turns out to be cooler or whatever and I
                become more famous than this other one. Now I've gotta decide
                what to do. I hate doing work, and that's what this seems like.
                I kinda want more cube owners to come forward so it's not so
                risky but then I won't get much out of coming forward, so time
                is of the essence.

                That's what's going on with me, mom. What do you think I should
                do here?
