                reputations for official looking logos and signatures. I
                responded, hoping to waste some scammer's time, maybe get a TED
                talk out of it.
              </p>
              <p>
                They responded, double-checking my interest in participating.
                The very next day a Homeland Security official showed up to my
                office and escorted me out. That was so embarrassing. I got so
                panicked in front of everyone. He didn't even give me a chance
                to push my code. More worrisome, he wasn't discreet at all.
                You'd think secret government programs would do the witness
                protection kidnap or disappearance thing. Not this guy.
              </p>
              <p>
                He took me to his home office. Again, they asked if I was
                interested. Now it was more serious so I hesitated. Governments
                tend to screw over people recruited into secret programs.
                However, there is a project at work coming up I'd very much like
                to skip. Participating sounded much better than that. They had
                me sign some non-disclosure agreements and such.
              </p>
              <p>
                They explained the program. Basically, the government finally
                figured out how to time travel and needs people willing to go
                back in time and test it out. A sub-goal of this project is to
                also gather information on how to alter history to make a better
                world. They aren't looking for much, even slightly better would
                be great they say.
              </p>
              <p>
                My mentor explained to me they initially had much higher hopes.
                The &quot;go back in time and kill Hitler&quot; change didn't
                yield the results they were looking for. Altering the course of
                history on such a large scale is a fickle thing. They began
                recruiting people like me for smaller missions after a few dozen
                failed attempts. They admitted it was hard to find volunteers.
              </p>
              <p>
                From what I understand the time travel itself is pretty cool. At
                least the rules are pretty straight forward. I pick a start time
                between now and 1945, they fork our universe in a simulator, and
                I get to live out a life in that universe until I
                &quot;die&quot; or end the simulation. Honestly, the fork our
                universe bit is the more interesting part to me, but time travel
                is cool too.
              </p>
              <p>
                It was hard to pick my first mission. My mentor recommended
                starting with something really, really small that I was also
                passionate about. I thought about going back in time and getting
                all of my favorite cancelled TV shows resurrected. There were
                some real cliffhangers I got screwed on. Even that my mentor
                said would probably be too big a change for my first time.
              </p>
              <p>
                My mentor's &quot;theme&quot; for his missions is interesting.
                He goes back to prevent car defects. He has gone back and
                scrubbed up a lot of manufacturing and software negligence. It
                is impactful, saves lives, and is prevented so early in the
                process that it rarely has negative side-effects. Sure, he does
                save some mass murdering children by saving their parents, but
                overall we are better off so it fits the quota of &quot;slightly
                better.&quot;
              </p>
              <p>
                He worked in car manufacturing so having prior experience in the
                history you're correcting may be the key for me too. The only
                thing I'm really knowledgeable about is programming. This will
                be my theme for now. I shall go back in time and rid the world
                of programmer suffering and mistakes, making my job when I get
                back easier to boot. Sounds like a plan, let's get started!

                <a href="#chapter-2:-typeof-null">Chapter 2: Typeof null</a>
              </h1>
              <p>
                I've done quite a bit of front-end development so there's a
                clear thing to fix: JavaScript. There is a lot of cruft and just
                plain stupid things in that language worth eradicating. I posted
                a question to StackOverflow: &quot;How are far back in time
                would I have to go to fix JavaScript?&quot; The question was
                closed for being too broad. I didn't feel ready to take on the
                whole language. I would chip away at it and I knew just where to
                start.
              </p>
              <p>
                In JavaScript, the type of null is &quot;object&quot; which is
                confusing because null is most often the absence of an object
                and otherwise a primitive type. This means in practice the
                variable being checked needs to be checked for both not being
                null and being of type object. Making the typeof null be
                &quot;null&quot; would probably make things &quot;slightly
                better.&quot;
              </p>
              <p>
                I submitted my mission brief and it was approved. The next step
                was making my plan of attack. I had originally thought it was a
                typo in the ECMAScript specification that everyone just rolled
                with. I researched how this bug actually crept in and like most
                things it was Brendan Eich's fault.
              </p>
              <p>
                The creator of JavaScript had only a week to make the first
                implementation, so these things happened. The typeof bug can be
                traced back to the initial project called Mocha. The issue was
                each value in the language was tagged with its type. Objects
                were stored in memory ending with 000, integers ended with 1,
                strings ended with 100, and so on. Null was represented as an
                object type 000 and its value being the C null pointer 0x00. The
                typeof operator only checked the type, not whether it was also a
                null pointer, so it returned &quot;object&quot;.
              </p>
              <p>
                I needed to make the check for the null pointer. This would be
                only a couple line changes in Mocha.
              </p>
              <p>
                When to travel to was less clear. Searching I could only find
                reference to &quot;10 days in May 1995&quot; but no exact days.
                The destination was Mountain View, California in the Netscape
                Communications office. I did not have an exact address but
                figured I could use the phone books from that time to find it
                once I got there.
              </p>
              <p>
                I was beginning to realize I was going to be dropping into a
                focal point of the history of the internet. Despite picking
                something I thought was simple, JavaScript easily could end up
                even worse than it is now. Luckily I had room to experiment.
              </p>
              <p>
                The scientist assigned to help me loaded up a simulation for the
                beginning of May 1995 to be sure I didn't overshoot it. I would
                be dropped onto what is modern day Castro Street in Mountain
                View and begin my quest. I would also start out with a couple
                hundred dollars to make it through my time.
              </p>
              <p>
                My first mission began. Not wasting any time I went to the
                nearest coffee shop and asked for a phone book to look up the
                Netscape office. It wasn't there. Netscape had only started a
                year prior so this wasn't surprising. I wasn't about to walk
                through the street asking people. I gave up and pulled out of
                the simulation.
              </p>
              <p>
                I dug deeper into Netscape and found their home office address
                and phone number in their IPO filing. 501 East Middlefield Road
                is the place, now filled by Symantec. It's good I found the
                address as it saves me an hour walk from Castro. I was ready to
                retry my mission.
              </p>
              <p>
                I walked into the office and asked to speak with Brendan Eich.
                The front desk phoned him and he came to greet me. We walked
                back to his desk. I read a bit about Scheme, his favorite
                language, beforehand so we could have something to talk about
                before I got into the real stuff. Once we sat I asked, &quot;So
                how's Mocha going?&quot;
              </p>
              <p>
                Brendan responded, &quot;What's Mocha?&quot; My heart sank. He
                hadn't gotten started at all this early in the month. Flapping
                butterfly wings flashed before my eyes. I knew I had already
                screwed this timeline. Naming is a big deal to programmers and
                so is wanting to be original. Now that I had thrown Mocha out
                there he was going to call it something different like Frappe or
                Cappuccino. It was downhill from here.
              </p>
              <p>
                I powered through and told him a story about a time where I
                forgot to handle the type reflection for the null pointer in my
                language. I explained the bug he would eventually write as if I
                had made the same mistake. I knew roughly how he implemented it
                using a discriminated union in C so I described it the same way.
              </p>
              <p>
                The whole conversation was very confusing for Brendan. A random
                weirdo showing up talking about language implementations only
                happens at meet ups. I put him at ease early on by saying I was
                a friend of Marc, one of Netscape's founders. I hoped that would
                imply to Brenden I was in the know about his upcoming work for
                the Netscape browser.
              </p>
              <p>
                We exchanged parting pleasantries and I left the office. I
                walked a few blocks, making sure I wasn't being watched and left
                the simulation.
              </p>
              <p>
                It takes awhile for the simulation to play out and process. My
                scientist pinged me a few hours later to share the results. She
                had some good and bad news for me.
              </p>
              <p>
                The good news I was right about the naming. While in the end it
                became &quot;JavaScript&quot; all the same, Brendan called Mocha
                &quot;Expresso&quot; instead. Honestly that made more sense as
                JavaScript was supposed to be for easier scripts than Java, so
                Expresso, express, quick, fast, etc.
              </p>
              <p>
                The bad news was nothing else changed. I had described the exact
                bug he would make no more than two weeks later and he still made
                it regardless. I thought I had ruined everything but my presence
                actually didn't make a difference. I had mixed emotions, but was
                mostly bitter he completely ignored my warning. I had to change
                up my approach.
              </p>
              <p>
                He didn't begin working on Mocha at the beginning of May. The
                month of May has 31 days so I decided to binary search May for
                the opportune day to call out the bug. At least getting access
                to Brendan at his office each time would be easy.
              </p>
              <p>
                I went back to the office in the middle of month and told him my
                exact same story. He had begun work on Mocha at this point and
                said he was making good progress. Once I finished my story, he
                told me about how he was modeling his language's variables in
                the same way and he showed me some of the code. Trying to hit
                the jackpot I asked if he had written the type reflection yet.
                He had just taken his first stab at it. This was awesome, I
                would be able to pair program this bug out of existence.
              </p>
              <p>
                We got into the typeof code and I was quick to point out he was
                never returning &quot;null&quot; for the null case. He read the
                code and said, &quot;Ah, yes. This is by design. Nulls indicate
                an empty reference to an object.&quot; My heart sank, my face
                went pale, and then I punched him in the face and ended the
                simulation.
              </p>
              <p>
                That was an overreaction, but things made sense now. Brendan
                considered it to be a feature, not a bug, so my original warning
                fell on deaf ears. He also wasn't categorically wrong. Languages
                with pointers worked this way, a pointer pointed at something or
                it didn't. But Brendan also didn't know what the fallout of this
                decision would be. He couldn't anticipate all the butt hurt
                comments in r/javascript, questions on StackOverflow, and
                downstream bugs that this decision would create.
              </p>
              <p>
                Now I had to convince Brendan it was a bad idea. I couldn't just
                tell him what happens in the future because that would screw up
                the timeline in some way. I didn't know of an exemplar language
                to speak to that existed in 1995. Nowadays it is much easier to
                discuss language design. To win arguments, you just say,
                &quot;That's not how Rust does it, dumb dumb.&quot; Back then
                pointers and null were where it was at. It seemed that to
                complete this mission I would have to buff up on programming
                language design in the context of 1995 to make a compelling
                case.
              </p>
              <p>
                Before I began researching my scientist interjected, &quot;You
                know you can possess people in these simulations, right?&quot;
                No one told me that was a thing I could do.
              </p>
              <p>
                We set the simulation to start that same day in the middle of
                May when Brendan was working at this desk. I dropped in as him,
                opened the typeof code, made the change, and got out in under a
                minute. No grand debate that devolves into bickering needed.
                Mocha was such a rush job he wouldn't go back and notice.
              </p>
              <p>
                I waited eagerly for the results. The scientist pinged me within
                the hour. The simulation didn't complete. She explained that the
                simulations process much faster when they don't reach present
                day. Making that typeof change caused a world extinction event
                somewhere down the line. She complimented me. &quot;This was
                your first time ending the world and in record time,&quot; she
                joked.
              </p>
              <p>
                I was fed up. The Internet of Things was going to be the death
                of us. This tiny change was the lynchpin. It is only a matter of
                time before something else causes IoT to kill us all. Truly our
                world is built on top of foundations made from C4.
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Fuck it,&quot; I said. We went home for the day.</p>
