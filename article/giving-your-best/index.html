                I have been a technical / team lead at Stripe for about three
                years now. I came into the role out of necessity. There was a
                gap to fill as my team was relocated and I was the only one to
                choose to move with it and stay on the team. It was a tough
                situation, essentially rebooting the team from square one and I
                was that square.
              </p>
              <p>
                The team has grown in both scope and humans-working-on-it size
                and I found myself playing a larger role in career development.
                People want to know how they are doing all the time, and I need
                answers for them.
              </p>
              <p>
                I'm fortunate to not have to evaluate people alone. Many people
                take part:

                It's a big machine so I can choose where I spend my time in
                contributing to it. I've been developing and experimenting with
                this idea of putting an emphasis on &quot;giving your
                best.&quot;

              </h1>
              <p>
                &quot;Giving your best&quot; is subjective. I am not asking
                anyone on the team to give me <em>my</em> best.
              </p>
              <p>
                Saying what should be done or what should have been done does
                not scale. We need to grow competent individuals who can act
                with autonomy. We have to motivate and improve the individual.
              </p>
              <p>
                It's lazy to deliver feedback like &quot;You should have done
                X.&quot; You may have decades of experience. Depending on your
                hiring process, the other person can be totally fresh to even
                more experienced. Between you and them there are years of
                non-overlapping experience that can make you think differently
                about any given task. We have to meet people where they are, not
                where we are or where anyone else is.
              </p>
              <p>
                So if we limit ourselves to evaluating the individual in the
                absence of others or ourselves, we must evaluate like someone
                like they evaluate themselves. So we have to ask them,
                &quot;What can you do better?&quot; And hold them accountable to
                doing just that.
              </p>
              <p>
                That framing makes everything easier. Say they mess up
                something, there will only be two scenarios:
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    They didn't know they could do it better. You have to teach
                    them how (and teach them how they can learn how).
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    They already knew at that moment they weren't doing their
                    best. You dig into why they choose to not do their best and
                    orient them towards doing so next time.
                  </p>
                </li>
              </ol>
              <p>Handling those two scenarios well, we need to:</p>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    Keep giving them new problems to solve (easy in a software
                    engineering job). They will develop their own notion of what
                    is best by drawing from these experiences.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    Observe when they continue to make the same types of
                    mistakes multiple times. This is where something is going
                    wrong, so we need to dig in and hold accountability.
                  </p>
                </li>
              </ol>
              <p>The final outcomes:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  (Best-case) You're systematically getting people to do their
                  next best work every time.
                </li>
                <li>
                  (Worst-case) You're giving plenty of feedback such that it
                  won't be unexpected when someone is let go for poor
                  performance.
                </li>

              <p>
                It's an interesting situation when people make mistakes after
                you've told them not to because getting to the root of it
                requires a lot of introspection. There are many ways things can
                break down:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    You've given the feedback incorrectly. &quot;Object-oriented
                    programming is bad,&quot; is a really fun snarky comment to
                    say but terrible feedback. Something abstract like that
                    needs hours to unpack and if you're not willing to commit,
                    you need more tactical feedback.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    They said they did understand, but they did not understand
                    the feedback. The relationship isn't healthy enough to
                    facilitate giving feedback. Habits borne from past work
                    experiences die hard and new relationships need some loose
                    &quot;rules of engagement.&quot; You might critique through
                    authority, not through reason and transparency.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    They said they did understand, and they did understand, but
                    for the next problem they didn't think the feedback was
                    applicable. This is where we think, &quot;oh this person
                    just isn't smart&quot; because they can't think to our
                    degree of abstraction. We have to give more concrete advice
                    (tactical) and improve their abstract thinking (increase
                    autonomy).
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    They said they did understand, and they did understand, and
                    they thought the advice was applicable, but didn't apply the
                    feedback due to competing factors. Again, habits bore from
                    past work experiences die hard. We have to hash out from the
                    basics what trade-offs are appropriate and establish shared
                    mental models.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    They said they did understand, and they did understand, but
                    don't think the feedback is right and so don't apply it.
                    Resolving these breakdowns is absolutely key to fostering
                    autonomy. It sucks they didn't listen to you but they had a
                    mind of their own to disregard a direction. That's pretty
                    awesome! You want peers with a diverse set of opinions. But
                    you can't lack trust or integrity either. Invite proactive
                    push-back, give their weak arguments more ammunition even if
                    you disagree, foster a culture of laying it all out.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    They applied the feedback too much. We have to again weigh
                    trade-offs and share mental models.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    They applied the feedback, and you were both wrong. Make
                    sure you both are learning from this.
                  </p>
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                With so many ways things can break down, we must keep an open
                mind and prepare for lengthy discussions to really resolve
                issues.

              <p>Take stock of repeat offenses after some time and whether:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  They are insurmountably incompetent. (They aren't improving.)
                </li>
                <li>
                  They are competent but lack a path to autonomy. (They are
                  improving, but not at a fast enough rate.)
                </li>
                <li>
                  You suck at mentorship. (You cannot properly assess the
                  situation.)
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                The incompetent people have to go. The competent but not
                autonomous people get a runway that you (or the organization,
                business) can afford, but then also need to go. If you are in a
                position where your job is mentor and you can't evaluate, you
                need to find a new role. This is the hard and harsh part, but
                everyone's time is limited.
              </p>
              <p>
                You can't be spending more than, for example, 15% of your own
                work time helping someone else. You can't re-do other people's
                work for them later. You have to be solving the problems well
                enough to not have to come back to them for quite awhile.
              </p>
              <p>
                You can't be mentoring a competent student forever. You can only
                aim to have them move on for better pastures or (the best) end
                up mentoring you (for a bit).
              </p>
              <p>
                Not everyone wants to be a mentor and that has to be okay.
                Mentorship is a ton of work to do, to produce a good outcome or
                not. Bringing people along is really impactful because it feels
                like a positive multi-level marketing scheme. But some parts of
                a business don't need to flourish like one. You need to find a
                good place to do your best work, whatever it is.
              </p>
              <p>
                This is massively important: if you (or your
                company/organization) can't follow through and let people go and
                put people in proper roles, then prepare for a grind. You will
                improve people marginally, but <em>you</em> will not be healthy.
                Find a company that can follow through.

              </h1>
              <p>
                Businesses almost always fail to capitalize on mentorship
                efforts (and use that as reason to not even try). You train the
                best people and they leave for absolutely good reasons and go
                off to live better lives, and the business doesn't get a cut.
                For the business it may have just been better to accept some
                mediocrity to stamp out anyone else's chance at success
                (zero-sum fallacy).
              </p>
              <p>
                I mean really: you follow this &quot;giving your best&quot;
                framework and what are you left with? Only with some of the most
                productive, challenging, rewarding periods of your career. It's
                really hard to put a price on that.
