                I have some new mentees! While I always mentor within my
                immediate team, I haven't had much time to mentor people
                embedded in other teams who are mid-career at the company. I'm
                more likely to be spinning up or training new folks and then
                they're off. Or if I'm mentoring someone outside the team it is
                usually about the tactical problem like a piece of code or
                design, not really prying into their team business.
              </p>
              <p>
                With my new mentees I do get to talk about team processes and as
                it turns out my team's a little bit of an odd duckling. So I
                wanted to break down some of how the team runs, what we've
                tried, and what's been working for us.
              </p>
              <h1 id="no-sprints"><a href="#no-sprints">No sprints</a></h1>
              <p>
                I can't even ease into a conversation before someone cuts me off
                with a, &quot;sprints are stupid, process for the sake of
                process&quot; remark. And of course, they are correct.

                Now there's broad sentiment that sprints are oriented around
                being meat grinders, meant to suck the most out of people at the
                cost of burnout. This is captured eloquently in a
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPT-DuG0UjU"
                  >joke from the creator of Clojure Rich Hickey</a
                >.
              </p>
              <p>
                However, as most engineers can't wait to tell me: engineers
                themselves do not like sprints. So why do we do them?
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    Inertia. Once a process is in place without also putting
                    into place a means to change it, it is seemingly hard to
                    change.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    The sprint isn't for the engineers. And this is the truth of
                    it in almost every case.
                  </p>
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                One of the big lies we tell ourselves is that there can be a
                single representation of work that fits all purposes. If true,
                that would be incredibly limiting and the world would be rather
                boring. And yet that is the central pitch of so many apps:
                &quot;everything in one place.&quot;
              </p>
              <p>
                Workplaces are infected with this reductive thinking, and it
                leads to tools like Jira: a rather poor choice for anything in
                particular but so many features you can force it into most
                processes. Everything is a ticket and tickets can have links,
                sub-tasks, epics, tags, and probably other things.
              </p>
              <p>
                Software development in medium and large businesses is not just
                engineers. There are usually managers and product/project
                managers (PMs) who are steering engineers to goals and reporting
                progress to their management chains.
              </p>
              <p>
                With only Jira at their disposal because of this incessant
                reductionist thinking about work, these work orchestrator types
                flock like moths to a flame. The flame is using Jira to assign
                new work and summarize work to their management chain. To
                achieve this, epics and tasks are shaped for those purposes, not
                for the work being done.
              </p>
              <p>
                Engineers tend to be more agreeable than managers/PMs simply
                because the manager/PM relationship often puts engineers
                underneath them. Disagreement and push back is more difficult
                than amongst peers. So process changes oriented towards the
                manager/PM aren't met with much friction. Slowly but surely, the
                manager/PM goals are met at the expense of engineers having to
                shoehorn their work into this process.
              </p>
              <p>
                This is the trap most engineering teams fall into and why they
                fall into it.
              </p>
              <p>These are bad arrangements for everyone:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  A usual manager to engineer ratio on a team is something
                  between 1:5 to 1:10 at most companies. Adopting any process
                  that inhibits the vast majority of the team is a significant
                  loss of productivity.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Engineers still have work to do and are presented with bad
                  options: 1) embrace the process and waste hours and hours
                  grooming tickets and expending lots of brain power on it, or
                  2) minimally participating in the process, running the risk of
                  being punished by working &quot;off script.&quot;
                </li>
                <li>
                  And the saddest irony of contorting the whole team's process
                  to be for the sake of the manager: tickets are not useful to a
                  manager who needs to report progress. No manager tells their
                  manager, &quot;Go look at our tickets.&quot; They always need
                  to provide overall, high level summaries, those latest updates
                  that are too costly/noisy to keep encoding in individual
                  tickets. An additional synthesizing process is tacked on to
                  gather that information.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                So how do we manage our work on my team? However we want. We
                have projects of 1-2 people on the team and between themselves
                they choose how to manage their tasks. Some folks create a bunch
                of tickets, some create hardly any. There's no format for these
                tickets, they contain whatever the people working on them find
                useful. The board is strictly for the engineering team, it
                doesn't serve ancillary purposes.
              </p>
              <p>
                We don't deny that managers and PMs have important roles in the
                process, but they don't need to infect the process. We're happy
                to give them tailored information they can most easily
                regurgitate up the management/reporting chains. The honest truth
                is that day to day and week to week there isn't much that needs
                to be reported so this doesn't take much time. For the team
                these things take about 30 minutes a week and is great because
                we:
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    Help represent an accurate narrative about the work being
                    done. A manager or PM trying to accurately summarize the
                    status of multiple projects by scouring dozens of tickets
                    leads to too many miscommunications and erodes trust in the
                    team.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    Free up the manager/PM to do the more important work. They
                    were gonna need to dig in and summarize if we didn't. Now
                    they can focus on the longer term priorities and how our
                    work does fit into the broad goals of the company.
                  </p>
                </li>
              </ol>
              <p>
                This style does take some managers some getting used to. As a
                team lead I often have to &quot;box out&quot; people from
                muddling in our board or talk with my manager about prying too
                deeply into individual tickets as opposed to focusing on overall
                project status, impact, and priority. Micro-management can be
                viciously self-enforcing if not called out early.
              </p>
              <p>
                The members of the team organize however they want and our board
                fulfills that purpose exclusively.
              </p>
              <p>
                This anti-work-reductionism has other positive pressures. For
                example, a common crutch teams use tickets for, when goaded to
                use them for everything, is documentation. With all the time we
                save not marking up our tickets with details that will drift out
                of date over the course of a project, we write proper, curated
                documentation of design decisions, implementation details, and
                guides/tutorials in the appropriate places. We don't scour
                tickets trying to understand our code.
              </p>
              <h1 id="quarterly-projects">
                <a href="#quarterly-projects">Quarterly projects</a>
              </h1>
              <p>
                I got really tired of the time lost on carpet-pulling of various
                projects surrounding and involving my team. Those types of 'high
                impact' projects that appear out of nowhere and suddenly need
                done.
              </p>
              <p>
                So I made a simple change: every quarter we chose the projects
                which had the highest impact for the company. If a submitted
                project didn't make the cut line, it would try again next
                quarter. It wasn't important enough. I wrote up this process
                change, circulated it, and got management chain approval. The
                team proceeded to be pushed but we stuck to our quarterly
                projects.
              </p>
              <p>
                Some people will argue quarterly planning is too rigid. A team
                needs to be more fluid and able to pivot with less than a whole
                90 days notice. Surely this allows for optimal utilization of
                resources.
              </p>
              <p>What actually happened is different:</p>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  Our team started to consistently hit all our goals every
                  quarter over quarter.
                </li>
                <li>
                  We always were working on the most important things so our
                  impact was always high, and because we actually delivered what
                  we promised all the better.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Since we weren't sucked into projects constantly, we more
                  properly did the work and didn't suffer a long tail of tech
                  debt that eventually needed to be burnt down.
                </li>
                <li>
                  And the spontaneous projects stopped coming our way before we
                  even had a chance to shoot them down.
                </li>
              </ol>
              <p>
                By all measures adopting quarterly projects was a success. Not
                only did we become more effective, we became reliably and
                predictably effective. A happy cycle that awards us more trust
                and more opportunity to experiment to become even more optimal.
              </p>
              <p>
                People tend to embrace shifting priorities eagerly. We all seek
                to avoid the sunken cost fallacy so much that we ignore that
                we're giving ourselves whiplash and under delivering.
              </p>
              <p>
                The stream of random projects that had been coming our way died
                out because:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    We held a firm line. &quot;You missed the boat, sorry.&quot;
                    Shifting priorities are the result of poor decision making.
                    It's kinda like electricity, it follows the path of least
                    resistance. After a couple successful push backs, we broke
                    our reputation as even entertaining random priorities.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    We had a transparent prioritization process that was aligned
                    with company priorities. We optimize for the best thing for
                    the whole company. Not our team, not our immediate reporting
                    chain, the whole company. Our priorities were documented
                    with evidence that they ranked the way they did. If someone
                    could come to us and legitimately convince us that things
                    had higher impacts based on <em>evidence</em> we could
                    change course. This has not happened.<br />
                    <br />
                    Most priorities shift because they are allowed to shift
                    without much justification, so requiring justification
                    spares us. Transparency also takes pressure off of our team.
                    Someone asking for us needs to be taking away a project from
                    someone else, and folks are less inclined to confront
                    another team. We are not a hat that more can be drawn out
                    of.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    Teams could get us to help, but they needed to reveal their
                    incompetence to do so. Their 'emergency' was a process
                    failure and would need to be corrected going forward. If
                    they wanted our help for an 'emergency' we required them to
                    file an incident which would be tracked and reviewed by
                    leadership. Suddenly they didn't need us.
                  </p>
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                I wasn't sure where quarterly projects would take us as a team.
                I've learned from seeing it play out that all of the churn in
                projects and priorities are a result of being too easily swayed
                by whims and poor justifications. I was prepared to burn a lot
                of earned social capital on this experiment, assuming it would
                take a year to really get the team out of the mix. However, it
                didn't take long at all for this process to become the norm.
              </p>
              <p>
                Now after running so long, the results of quarterly projects
                have spoken for themselves and continue to solidify our position
                as a high performing, predictable team.
              </p>
              <p>
                A small note on why quarters as opposed to halves: quarters
                being 90 days feel appropriate to run a small/medium size
                project end to end and deliver completely. This isn't to say we
                don't do the longer projects, but we aren't locked into them. We
                aim to hit our goals for a quarter so we choose projects that
                will 1) meaningfully contribute to a larger project's direction,
                and 2) if it turns out to either be the wrong approach or is
                solved well enough in that quarter we don't overcommit to
                something we don't believe needs done.
              </p>
              <p>
                There's a joke I heard somewhere that's like: talking about what
                your team will be doing in two years is kind of like talking
                about what happens after you die. You can only plan tactically
                and know you're not wasting time in halves. Anything longer than
                that has got to be very light abstract/vision work.
              </p>

              </h1>
              <p>
                I mentioned this above but wanted to break down this decision a
                bit more.
              </p>
              <p>
                Software engineering is a team effort, but the reality is
                individuals are measured/evaluated by the business
                independently.
              </p>
              <p>
                On my team everyone gets a project they get to completely run
                end-to-end, however they want to. They get the credit for that
                work in performance results. No one is ever without something to
                show for their efforts in a way leadership can't appreciate.
                (Leadership can only appreciate the high-level, overall project
                impact, never any handful of tasks completed along the way.)
              </p>
              <p>
                So that's frankly the main reason. Individuals are incentivized
                and rewarded for successfully running larger and larger projects
                basically on their own and so we throw ourselves into the deep
                end and give everyone those projects. Yes, we help each other
                and work through problems together but the work, the meat, is
                only done by 1-2 people per project.
              </p>
              <p>
                There are other great benefits to this approach such as much
                lower coordination overhead, the fact that the best work in
                software engineering is almost consistently done by 1-2
                engineers, the incredible capacity for people to learn much more
                quickly when working on problems in full, and the sense of trust
                imparted to engineers to do their best work empowering them to
                do just that in a healthy way.

                Mistakes will always be made, no one can solve that away at
                scale. The only thing you can do is empower the individual to do
                their best work and that means giving them the rope to climb. A
                team lead can always come in and save the day for the business
                if needed, but that's a last resort. We need a killer team and
                they need the initial trust and mentorship to work towards that.

              </h1>
              <p>A grab bag of others things we do:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    &quot;Office hours&quot; (like college professors do). A
                    dedicated time slot that anyone can book to meet directly
                    with the engineering team. It's an hour every week and no
                    friction: folks just add their topic to a table for the
                    office hour date. We pre-read their documents and discuss
                    their problems in person. There's no commitment from us to
                    do anything (cuz quarterly planning), it is strictly
                    advisory.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    &quot;Brown bag&quot; (cuz it's supposed to happen at the
                    end of the lunch hour) Since folks are on their own projects
                    most of the time, we do a meeting to go over designs or new
                    things we learn as we're working on projects. This is
                    totally voluntary to present at. We trust each other to
                    raise concerns about our projects when we have them.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    &quot;Campfire.&quot; We have tons of things we do review as
                    a team, mostly for knowledge sharing purposes. Those
                    individual things aren't themselves meeting worthy so we jam
                    them all into one mega two hour meeting once a week to get
                    it all done. This is where all our overflow discussions from
                    the week get talked about at length. We optimize this
                    meeting to be high value and usually finish early.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    No meeting Wednesday. A fully dedicated day there can be no
                    meetings. Anyone outside the team booking time we can
                    explain we are busy and cancel. It's a predictable
                    heads-down time to work.

                This process I am documenting now will change. It took a lot of
                incremental evolutions to get to this process and it works for
                now.
              </p>
              <p>How do you facilitate change?</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Anytime someone says a process sucks, don't ignore that
                  feedback. There's a problem to address. Folks say you can't
                  make everyone happy with the process and that is true. The
                  things we can truly agree on as a team do. The rest leave to
                  individuals to decide. Don't have fights between members of a
                  team or folks that go along with it just for the sake of it.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Don't change multiple things at once. If there are many
                  changes you want to change, do the one that's going to have
                  the biggest impact. Rocking the boat in too many directions
                  usually means we've left someone out who isn't fully bought in
                  or you're making changes for &quot;right now&quot; not for the
                  successful, predictable team you want to be. It's also super
                  hard to measure the impact of multiple changes at once and too
                  easy to overshoot and miss something valuable that was lurking
                  in the process.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Embrace that people work differently and that the process can
                  be changed by anyone as long as they bring the team along.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                The road has been long, but at least for the past few years I
                have enjoyed the team processes we've arrived at. Hopefully some
                of this reasoning and context motivates you to make those
                process changes you've wanted to make!
