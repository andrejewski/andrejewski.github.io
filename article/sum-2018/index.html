                still getting used to the tablet. The feedback on the comics has
                been really positive and that keeps me going.

              <h2 id="open-source"><a href="#open-source">Open-source</a></h2>
              <p>
                I have done a lot of open-source work. Compared to prior years,
                2018 was relatively light. I released
                <a href="/raj/">Raj</a> this year, and that was substantial.
              </p>
              <p>
                However, most of my personal work is no longer open. Frankly,
                this is due to my inability to find reusable abstractions which
                might benefit others. In order to focus on products, I've
                sacrificed solving problems generally. When I find good
                abstractions and tools to open source, I will.
              </p>
              <p>
                I do not anticipate open-source playing a big role in the work I
                have planned for 2019. I will be happy to be proven wrong.

              <p>
                Most of the travel this year was for work. My trips to
                California became clock work. Never in my life did I picture
                myself having such an intimate understanding of the O'Hare
                airport. I also had to get used to rental cars. I had many this
                year and have to say the Ford Escape was the best.
              </p>
              <p>
                We had a company retreat in Charlotte, North Carolina early in
                the year. That was a good time and took me through the
                Philadelphia airport. I hadn't gone through there since I was
                ten.
              </p>
              <p>
                It's not a real summer unless I take a road trip so long it
                takes a mental toll. I drove down to visit friends in North
                Carolina for the week of July 4th. Then I drove over to
                Nashville to see my Erie friend at his summer internship. This
                was over 24 hours of driving in total.
              </p>
              <p>
                I took my first vacation days ever for a week in late July to
                visit the Smokey Mountains. Getting there I flew from San Jose
                to Denver to the McGhee Tyson airport. My group got a nice cabin
                with a hot tub and being out in nature was great. The area
                around the Smokey Mountains has a crazy amount of non-nature
                stuff to do as well.
              </p>
              <p>
                This year's travel was plagued with misadventures for sure. Most
                notable:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    A cancelled flight from O'Hare to Erie made me fly to
                    Buffalo and drive a rental car back to Erie so I wouldn't
                    miss a wedding (my first). They lost my luggage but had it
                    driven back to me by the next morning.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    A cancelled flight from Philadelphia to Erie because the
                    plane was broken. We had to wait until 3am to get our
                    luggage off of the plane and I spent a night in a comped
                    hotel.
                  </p>
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>There were some notably good times too:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <p>I sat across from Bob Odenkirk at the O'Hare airport.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    My final flight of the year into SFO was on a way
                    under-booked airliner. Every person in boarding group 5 got
                    their own row of seats. It was the most productive, most
                    relaxing flight I've ever taken.
                  </p>
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h2 id="comet"><a href="#comet">Comet</a></h2>
              <p>
                My best friend passed away on November 9th. Comet was eleven
                years old. He went blind in October 2017 and was on a slow
                decline. When I was remote, I took care of him during the day.
                As I began traveling for work more and eventually moved to San
                Francisco, my mom took care of him. After many death scares, she
                decided to put him down before he became a complete mess.
              </p>
              <p>
                My biggest regret this year was not being there for him during
                his last moments. I miss Comet a lot.

                My first project this year was making a dashboard for monitoring
                airplane security. Still sounds really cool but was a relatively
                simple project that I completed in two days. It was the first
                time I used Raj at work.
              </p>
              <p>
                Shortly after, I switched into Node/web-app consulting for the
                world's most valuable publicly traded company of 2018. The
                project (still ongoing) is to unify many internal infrastructure
                tools from a single control plane. The scope of the project
                includes configuration, deployments, and abstractions to allow
                projects to transition to modern tools like Kubernetes. I worked
                primarily on the back-end of the project which was a mix of Node
                and Python.
              </p>
              <p>
                This was my first consulting project where I had to go onsite
                with a team. I made the trip from Erie, PA to San Jose, CA and
                back five times from April to August. That meant tons of flying,
                rental cars, hotels, and an Airbnb. I spent 2 months of the year
                in California onsite.
              </p>
              <p>
                In June, I started working on moving into a new job. There were
                a lot of factors that drove the decision.
              </p>
              <p>
                First, front-end engineering was getting rote. I released the
                v1.0 of Raj, which I had been working on for a year. Raj was my
                front-end magnum opus, distilling how to front-end the right
                way. As it turns out the right way is boring, every program is
                exactly the same. I thought front-end was a solved problem, so
                it was time to move on to something else.
              </p>
              <p>
                Second, it wasn't clear how to grow in my current job. Pressure
                to improve was solely driven by me. Day to day I was spending a
                considerable amount of time helping and mentoring others. That's
                not a bad thing surely, but I felt I still had a lot more to
                learn.
              </p>
              <p>
                Third, the stars aligned. On one onsite trip, I took a day trip
                to San Francisco to do the tourism. I stepped off the BART and,
                never one to ride-share, walked the whole day. From the piers to
                the Golden Gate Bridge and back to the BART is about 14 miles.
                Walking through the city, very tired and dehydrated, I saw
                someone wearing a t-shirt that made me audibly gasp. It was then
                I realized I needed to change jobs.
              </p>
              <p>
                At the beginning of August, I accepted an offer to join
                <a href="https://stripe.com/">Stripe</a>. I got that Stripe
                t-shirt I saw. It still often hits me how crazy it is I work
                there.
              </p>
              <p>
                I applied as a full-stack engineer, confident in front-end but
                wanting to do more. I moved to San Francisco and started work in
                September. This was a big change. No more front-end, I do
                back-end and infrastructure work. No more JavaScript, I write
                Ruby. No more remote work, I sit right next to everyone on my
                team. (Okay, still some remote work.)
              </p>
              <p>
                The last part of this year I spent working on email
                infrastructure. I had always assumed email had to really
                complex, and I was right. Security has become a much bigger
                concern to me than it ever had previously. I am learning a lot
                for sure and that is what I wanted.
              </p>

              <p>
                Next year, I need to push myself further. Looking back at my
                momentum from 2016 to 2018, I really want to keep that up. It is
                going to take a lot of work just to maintain, so we'll see how
                it goes. I am optimistic.
              </p>
