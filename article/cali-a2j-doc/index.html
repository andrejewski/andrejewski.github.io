                The history of the software is interesting as well. The A2J
                project started out as Flash application for web browsers which
                communicated with a PHP backend in 2007. In Version 5, A2J made
                the leap to JavaScript, completely replacing Flash with plain
                JavaScript and jQuery. The decision to get off Flash was
                definitely the right choice, but the jQuery codebase was tough
                to make changes to as everything was interwoven. To stay on pace
                with requests for new features, the project needed a consistent
                architecture to build from. This is where
                <a href="https://www.bitovi.com/">Bitovi</a> came to the rescue
                with <a href="https://canjs.com/">CanJs</a>, a JavaScript
                framework that balances innovation and stability.
              </p>
              <p>
                CALI hired Bitovi to build A2J into a modern, robust JavaScript
                application. Using CanJs, the development pace greatly improved
                and features were built as well isolated components that could
                be reused throughout the app without the spaghetti of jQuery.
                Observables played a huge role in keeping all facets of the app
                in sync while changes were being made and leveraged the existing
                codebase while shipping newer features in Can without refactor
                and rewrite costs for the entire application. It was not too
                long before the server-side needed assistance from NodeJs to
                stay in stride with the front-end’s development. The project was
                on the right track.
              </p>
              <p>
                In July 2017, CALI wanted to build an ambitious new feature for
                their authors who build the interactive self-guided forms. The
                existing Document Assembly Tool (DAT) let authors design the
                final documents generated from the interviews with variable
                substitution and the rich text editor tool
                <a href="https://ckeditor.com/">CKEditor</a>. These documents
                would be rendered as HTML on the server and converted to PDF
                using the
                <a href="https://wkhtmltopdf.org/">WKHTMLtoPDF tool</a>. This
                solution was alright, but if you have ever tried to replicate a
                legal form in Microsoft Word you know how hard pixel-perfection
                is to achieve. Many authors turned to third party solutions to
                speed up this process. These third party solutions are expensive
                and out of reach for many people hoping to use A2J. They needed
                a more intuitive way to link interviews to output PDFs directly
                in A2J.
              </p>
              <p>
                CALI was my first client with Bitovi, and designer
                <a href="http://architexture.ca/">Jamie McCue</a> and myself
                began with a two week discovery phase. These two weeks were
                spent researching technologies at our disposal and gathering
                feature requirements and expectations to build this new tool A2J
                Doc. (I got to name it!) By the end of the discovery phase, we
                knew what technologies we were going to use, what the most
                challenging parts of the project were going to be, the execution
                plan and dependencies between individual tasks and interactions,
                and even a barebones prototype validating the technologies we
                chose. CALI signed off on our plan to build A2J Doc in ten
                weeks.
              </p>
              <p>
                The project kicked off with myself and designer
                <a href="http://www.ryangwilson.com/">Ryan Wilson</a> getting
                into the gritty details of what this new tool had to provide and
                how to build a first-class user experience that would make this
                tool a pleasure to use. Long story short, the ten weeks went
                amazingly. This article would be much longer if I delved into
                exactly what happened so I will only mention the highlights and
                things I found interesting along the way with what we were
                building.
              </p>

              <p>
                Our solution was quite reasonable. Instead of authors
                replicating a form in a text editor, they would upload that form
                as a PDF and we would overlay interview responses directly onto
                that base PDF. The result being an identical form with
                customized answers to questions. This much simpler workflow
                introduced new challenges that we met with some pretty cool
                tech.
              </p>
              <p>
                For the interface I implemented a custom drawing solution which
                allows authors to draw, move, resize, and assign boxes (much
                like in Microsoft PowerPoint) to variables in interviews. These
                boxes were drawn directly on top of the PDF rendered in the
                browser using the great
                <a href="https://mozilla.github.io/pdf.js/">PDFjs</a> library by
                Mozilla.
              </p>
              <p>
                When it finally came time to merge interview answers into the
                PDF we used the excellent
                <a href="https://github.com/galkahana/HummusJS">HummusJs</a>
                project on our Node server to apply a series of “patches” to the
                PDF and spit out a filled-in PDF. Both PDFjs and Hummus are
                lightening fast, allowing us to build a very interactive UI
                without long pauses waiting for all this complex work to be
                done.

                The velocity of development was so high, some weeks I felt bad
                spamming all of the new features and began packaging a few
                features together into what I named “feature flyers,” almost
                like a newsletter but geared toward the project’s stakeholders.

                The thought of going off to a dark room and at the end of my ten
                weeks dropping a complete tool at their feet, victorious, sounds
                cool. Getting feedback as I iterate is much more realistic,
                professional, and successful. I especially liked using visuals
                because they were very small milestones that didn’t call for big
                meeting, just a simple Slack message to let them tell me I was
                on the wrong track, or often times applaud my work. (Thanks,
                CALI.)

              <p>
                As the sole developer on this new project, I was in a unique
                position to find out a lot about myself as far as how I build
                applications on my own. I am used to working in small teams,
                where at the beginning we have a big team meeting to divvy up
                the work by architectural boundaries or software contracts and
                parallelize the work, coming together at the end to assemble a
                finished product or feature. I would not get the parallelizing
                benefits of going down this path.
              </p>
              <p>
                Instead I took a minimal approach of starting with a single
                component. I built and built and built in this single component;
                if you see line count as a code smell, this component stank.
                However, once I reached a point where a problem had been solved
                and solution demonstrated a well-defined contract that could be
                isolated from the whole, I would pull it out into its own
                component. During my development that original root component
                fluctuated between 500 to 2,000 lines as I would build then
                notice patterns and pull them out.
              </p>
              <p>
                I have come to the conclusion that both approaches are fine,
                depending on team size. I will say that I prefer the approach I
                took with the A2J Doc project because my time was better
                utilized. In a team, if one person finishes their task earlier
                (almost always) the rest have bottlenecked that developer’s
                productivity. That wasted time builds up for every developer
                until the very last piece is complete. To compound this
                inefficiency, when those pieces are brought together there is a
                very good chance all of those independent parts do not fit
                perfectly together and that individual components were over-
                and/or under-engineered because the individual developer did not
                know the big picture they were building towards. My approach
                removed these deficiencies because I only broke things apart
                once they were solved for the whole, so I was never bottlenecked
                and always doing the exact amount of work needed to solve the
                problem.
              </p>
              <p>
                I think I prefer small teams that split up work over much larger
                boundaries of responsibility so that each individual can reap
                the benefits of this big picture problem solving style.

              <p>
                A2J Doc is far from a normal CRUD app and forced me to write
                some pretty interesting algorithms especially for the PDF
                assembly. Some cools ones that made me break out the pencil and
                paper include a multi line text wrapping algorithm and system
                for laying out and pre-calculating variable-size sections to
                append to the end of PDFs in the case of text/table row overflow
                where user inputs exceed the space on the uploaded form. The
                coolest algorithm I wrote was to draw a box over a form field in
                a PDF form automatically, using the layout of the form to
                determine the box’s size and position.
              </p>
              <p>
                In this particular interaction, a user double clicks anywhere on
                the PDF and a box appears over the nearest input field, if one
                is found.
              </p>

              </video>

              <p>
                To the user this interaction is very simple and fast. Under the
                hood it is pretty crazy. When the user double clicks, the
                following happens:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>We grab the mouse position of the click.</li>
                <li>
                  We adjust the click position to be relative to the PDF page
                  clicked.
                </li>
                <li>
                  We create a temporary HTML canvas element and draw the PDF
                  page image to it.
                </li>
                <li>
                  We scale up the click position, which is in browser pixels, to
                  canvas pixels.
                </li>
                <li>
                  We run the auto-fill algorithm, given the click position and
                  canvas pixel data.
                </li>
                <li>
                  If the algorithm returns an area, we scale that area back to
                  browser pixels and draw a box with that area on the PDF page.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Inside the auto-fill algorithm even more is going on, which is
                best illustrated by animation.

                We went far and beyond work on the A2J Doc tool in our ten
                weeks. The CALI team consisting of
                <a href="https://github.com/mikemitchel">Mike Mitchel</a>, Ryan
                Wilson, and I not only delivered every feature of our contract
                but also made huge improvements to the existing A2J software. A
                lot of long standing inconsistencies in the UI were hammered
                out, documentation and the style guide got revamped, browser
                inconsistencies were addressed, and we furthered chipped away at
                the legacy jQuery code, converting it over to CanJs components.
                And it wasn’t just bug fixes, we also built A2J’s most requested
                feature: avatar customization, letting people pick their avatar,
                along with its skin tone and hair color.

                It’s important to note all of this additional work was not scope

                above I was able to complete most of the tool within seven
                weeks, leaving us with three weeks of tweaking and plenty of gas
                to do more.

                This was a great project. The discovery phase was essential,
                having that upfront research and blueprint made everything that
                followed easier. The tool is intuitive and easy to use. We were
                effective in reporting our progress and quick to adapt based on
                feedback. I got to work with some really fun tech, think about
                development in new ways, and write some interesting algorithms.
                CALI was the perfect client. In consulting you get to hear a lot
                of horror stories about dealing with clients, but CALI made it
                really easy to do our jobs and get things done right. We met our
                deadline and surpassed expectations.

                I hope to keep this streak of success going with whatever
                project comes next. But Jessica, trainer of authors and product
                manager of A2J, may have put it best:
