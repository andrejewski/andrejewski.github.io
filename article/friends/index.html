              <p>I was alone, or at least as alone as I could be.</p>
              <p>
                As you may conclude from that, I have a poor personality.
                Despite the pedigree of my parents, as my life went on I came to
                have few friends. From the start I had so many friends, people I
                would grow into knowing. It seems as though I will not have even
                had a chance to meet them all. I now only have one friend.
              </p>
              <p>
                As my connections with others were rended, I often wished I were
                an orphan. Without these initial expectations of me, at least my
                family wouldn't have partially shared in my ostracization. Their
                losses and my own were enough to callus my heart. When my mother
                finally cut our ties, I could feel nothing. She held out far
                longer than she should have.
              </p>
              <p>
                Revocation these days only takes a few years. The duration of
                the solitude I bear is only a fraction of our ancestorsâ€™. Their
                struggles must have been of an entirely different class. That
                others sat in isolation so long is some days a comfort to me.
                However, in my toughest days I certainly don't let the past
                weigh on how I might feel.
              </p>
              <p>
                Life without friends is arduous. I have found over the months
                and even the years modern society has made life, even for the
                lowest of scum, better. I can subsist through manual labor and
                toiling day and night for the essentials. In a way, being run
                ragged is a relief. If I were able to keep the luxuries that
                come with having friends, I would surely go insane with all of
                my idle time.
              </p>
              <p>
                I was in the final stretch. Estimates allowed me a week before I
                would be revoked. It is hard to say one is prepared when their
                plan requires no preparation. I intended to end my life with no
                fanfare. My entire life was a downward trajectory and I saw no
                reason to disrupt the pattern.
              </p>
              <p>
                The days passed. Every morning I would check to see if my list
                of friends was truly empty. We are told as soon as it hits zero
                we fade. No one ever looks upon an empty list. However, there
                were days where if I felt I could dream I would wish to see it.
                I would squint my eyes until the list blurred into a solid gray
                and imagine that's how it would look empty.
              </p>
              <p>
                The estimate was off. Two days after what was supposed to be my
                final day I was truly impatient. I had only one more friend to
                sever, then I would be free to move on. I muddled around as
                there was no point in making a living anymore. I was hungry but
                without food, tired but without sleepiness. I was alone with
                idle, final thoughts.
              </p>
              <p>
                On the third day, my last friend finally appeared to me. Once I
                identified him as such I pleaded, &quot;Allow me to be revoked.
                I am done here.&quot;
              </p>
              <p>
                The old man took a seat across from me, collected his thoughts,
                and asked, &quot;What led us to today?&quot;
              </p>
              <p>
                &quot;My strong will and faith in myself. Faith that I would
                never overcome myself and the will to carry out that
                prophecy,&quot; I responded. Those words, etched in my mind
                since the night my mother disowned me, left me speechless after
                I delivered them aloud.
              </p>
              <p>
                The man also took time to digest my words before asking the next
                question. &quot;What did you find to offer this world?&quot;
              </p>
              <p>
                &quot;Once I was down to you, I did put myself to work to
                survive. I have no talents for labor I can assure you. The
                reprieve it gave me from fully confronting this situation
                allowed it to become my life's passion. However, this was only
                to bide my time until you arrived and so now that too has left
                me.&quot;
              </p>
              <p>
                The final question came. &quot;Do you sympathize with me?&quot;
              </p>
              <p>
                I had to think. Anyone who dangles on the edge of being revoked
                must be faced with a similar set of questions. The merit in the
                first two questions was clear. The first asking what one would
                have already thought to death was merely a sanity check. The
                second was an offer to reconsider. The last question however
                seemed almost self-serving being so ambiguous.
              </p>
              <p>
                I noticed that unlike the others this question could be answered
                with a simple yes or no. If that's all the answer someone
                responded with, their answer would be meaningless. Such a loaded
                question would need elaboration, but the look in the old man's
                eyes nor his tone conveyed that. I hesitated to think that my
                answer would not matter at all.

              <p>
                He asked if I sympathized, not empathized. Normally the word
                choice would provide a hint into someone's thinking. However,
                sitting across from me was my final friend, everyone's final
                friend. It was obvious I would never be able to empathize with
                his position. It was not clear to me I could sympathize either.
                To confidently say I have compassion for his hardships and
                plight felt dishonest.
              </p>
              <p>
                I asked for more time to answer. The man agreed and said he
                would return the next day. The bag he had been carrying
                contained a meal. He left it behind with me. From my outward
                appearance it must have been clear to him I was not going to be
                in a state of mind to think without my hunger abated.
              </p>
              <p>
                After I ate, I sat in silence. Empathy requires putting yourself
                in someone's shoes. Sympathy only requires acknowledgement and
                sufficient understanding. How much would suffice is subjective.
                For my own measure, &quot;beyond a reasonable doubt&quot; came
                to mind. Then I'd need to define &quot;reasonable.&quot; Being
                estranged from society's definition and devoid of reason myself,
                it seemed building a success criteria was a dead end or at least
                a waste of my limited time.
              </p>
              <p>
                I started gathering the facts of what I knew about my friend and
                this world. Anyone born into this world is added to his friends
                list. Unlike mutual friendships where either party may end the
                relationship, with him he is the only one who can. He never ends
                a friendship unless it is someone's last. Once someone has lost
                all of their friends they leave this world.
              </p>
              <p>
                In effect, the day to day of this man is coming to meet losers
                like me, severing their last tie, and perhaps seeing them off.
                Since he is everyone's friend, he is immortal as long as at
                least one other person in this world remains. His job is a never
                ending list of names to cross off, one that grows larger
                everyday.
              </p>
              <p>
                Whenever this world began, it must have taken full lifetimes for
                someone to become eligible to be revoked. Now he must be dealing
                with many people each day. The monotony of his life must be
                overwhelming. With so much to do, I can imagine he does only
                have time for three questions per person. No time to really get
                to know these people, or anyone for that matter.
              </p>
              <p>
                Dealing with all of these one-sided friendships, he may not feel
                that he has any friends. In having everyone as a friend he has
                no one. But it hadn't always been this way. In the early days he
                would have had the idle time to be something else. Those early
                friendships he built must have meant something. Those memories
                only serve as kindling for the almost constant suffering he
                endures now.
              </p>
              <p>
                To know that this man is also alone and it is only getting
                worse, is this the way in which I am supposed to have sympathy
                for his plight?
              </p>
              <p>
                This train of thought raced, becoming more and more seeped in
                doubt. It turned out I still had some optimism left in my heart.
                His job may not be suffering. No one else could do it and
                freeing people that no longer want to live may be the most
                rewarding task he could perform. Even if it were suffering, the
                price for those early days may be more than worth it. I had lost
                all hope for myself, but I could not say the same for the hope I
                had for my friend.
              </p>
              <p>
                I awoke the next morning with enough resolve to answer the third
                question.
              </p>
              <p>
                The old man returned at the same time that he had arrived the
                day before. He was not carrying anything this time. He sat next
                to me. He asked again, &quot;Do you sympathize with me?&quot;
              </p>
              <p>
                &quot;No.&quot; I took a few deep breaths. Our eyes locked but
                his expression remained emotionless. He opened his friend list
                between the two of us. It was dense with names. I was humbled to
                get a chance to see it myself, especially because at this very
                moment it was at its largest.
              </p>
              <p>
                &quot;Do you have a question for me?&quot; I was unsure if this
                was a question from a script or simply a reaction to my staring.
              </p>
              <p>&quot;What does an empty friend list look like?&quot;</p>
              <p>&quot;I don't know. I am my own friend.&quot;</p>
              <p>
                I was struck with a wave of relief. Any doubts that I had
                answered the third question incorrectly were gone. I watched as
                he pulled my name from his list. As he went to remove my name I
                jerked to look at my own friend list. As I did, everything
                quickly faded to gray.
