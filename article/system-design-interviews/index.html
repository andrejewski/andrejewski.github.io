                For the past couple years I've worked on Stripe's engineering
                interview committee. Our remit is the design, scoring, and
                curation of technical interview questions for engineering
                individual contributors (ICs) and engineering managers (EMs). My
                areas of ownership/responsibility are:
              </p>

                <li>
                  <p>
                    Some of our internal tooling for engineers participating in
                    the hiring process. All engineering ICs beyond
                    L1/entry-level participate in the hiring process for other
                    engineers. We conduct interviews and score candidates using
                    rubrics. These rubrics are designed by the committee and
                    volunteers. We build and maintain some tools for engineers
                    to apply to spin-up on new interviews and see which
                    interviews they are trained up for.

                    I also steward the system design interviews Stripe uses.
                    When I interview candidates this is my exclusive focus and I
                    really enjoy it. On the committee, I've facilitated rubric
                    changes. I advocate, explain, and iterate on the signals we
                    try to capture using our system design questions.

                  The signals I've found in practice to demonstrate a firm

                <li>

                This is not an article on how to hack Stripe's interview
                process. This is because fortunately the rubric puts emphasis on
                practical experience and well reasoned decisions, not specific
                design patterns, algorithms, or buzzwords. We poke, prod, and
                push candidates on their decisions: it's difficult to rehearse
                or fake it for such a dynamic interview.

              <p>
                No component of the system should lack a compelling purpose. The
                purpose needs to be more compelling than the added complexity it
                brings. Carelessly added or unjustified components often take
                the shape of complex data pipelines, caches, or unnecessary
                redundancy.
              </p>
              <p>
                Unfamiliar technologies are perfectly alright but they must be
                presented in terms of &quot;first principles.&quot; For example,
                someone may articulate a special/custom database for the
                presented problem, but they must not pepper over those essential
                truths (correctness, latency, atomicity, CAP theorem, time- and
                space-complexities of data structures, etc) under the guise of
                &quot;it works&quot; or &quot;it's magic.&quot;

                Alternatively put: have the design fit the requirements well.
                There are the basic functional requirements, then the
                non-functional, and so on to touch organizational concerns and
                as you scale trading off multiple competing goals against each
                other.
              </p>
              <p>
                Sometimes the goals are obvious, other times you should lean on
                your interviewer to be the oracle of user needs and
                organizational context.

                Okay, so how can a capable candidate present their design to
                maximally hit on these signals?
              </p>

                Software engineering interviews have a bad reputation. Puzzles,
                algorithm questions, and trick questions. Most candidates'
                instincts are to demonstrate a vocabulary, not an in-depth
                understanding of problem solving. This often leads to candidates
                out of the gate rattling off: cache, queue, load balancer,
                shards, consistent hashing, and cache again. This will lose you
                points massively when a measure is simplicity.
              </p>
              <p>
                Instead, I always tell candidates upfront that they should start
                with the simplest thing possible. Understand the functional
                requirements and hit them. This should be really quick. (If you
                are asked to diagram a system, draw this out to start with.)
                Demonstrating you understand what can be the simplest thing
                possible speaks volumes.
              </p>
              <p>
                This style is advantageous because complexity is more palatable
                when it is justified. With a basic structure in place you can
                now move from merely solving the problem to solving it well. You
                can now always make a trade-off decision: to add something else
                you must trade it off against simplicity, which should be hard
                to do because you should value simplicity. This sets you up to
                tell a good story.

              <p>
                Oftentimes in larger engineering organizations, we tend to form
                groups of more specialized roles going from generalist to
                ‘front-end, back-end‘ to ‘product, platform, infra’ and so on.
                This layering is a means of organizing and making work, to some
                degree of well, people who often aren’t presently capable of
                being those do-it-all generalists. (And of course individual
                specialists in the field are truly temporarily irreplaceable,
                but any engineering organization ought to actively mitigate this
                as a risk to the business.) The really strong engineers don’t
                exist in one of these single bubbles, they must transcend them
                to some degree to make really successful systems.
              </p>
              <p>
                This is something that I’ve come to learn really well working on
                platform teams for more than half a decade. Achieving a
                successful design is not solving for your immediate internal
                stakeholders most of the time. Instead it is extracting the
                essence of what the very best internal teams are doing for
                external customers and commoditizing it for the rest of the
                organization to leverage. You must make internal stakeholders
                happy, but they should only be happy doing the work that will
                make the end user happy. It’s an interesting game of guard rails
                and incentives.
              </p>
              <p>
                That is one example, another is designing for your future self
                or for the future team which will be tasked with making changes.
              </p>
              <p>
                Through this multi-faceted lens you can ask what people are
                trying to do and why and how your system can help (if it
                should).
              </p>
              <p>
                Now this is all rather meta, and in an interview you’ll have
                even less to come close to articulating a narrative such as
                this. What we can do tactically is:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Narrow scope. Cut, cut, cut anything not essential to the
                  tasks needed. Do not add any additional features or nice to
                  haves. You will not have time to do them justice.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Call out what the system won’t be for, provide an example of
                  some use case that won’t be served.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Enumerate the stakeholders. You don’t have to perfectly embody
                  each one. State that there are more stakeholders than might
                  meet the eye.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h2 id="approach"><a href="#approach">Approach</a></h2>
              <p>
                With a simple design for a well-defined problem, how you then
                solve it well is up to you. Presenting a philosophy and
                progression is a great way to demonstrate this isn’t your first
                rodeo. Here’s mine, as in what I solve and in what order:
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>Correctness</li>
                <li>Error handling</li>
                <li>Reliability</li>
                <li>Scale</li>
                <li>Maintenance</li>
              </ol>
              <p>Let’s lightly map these out in more detail.</p>
              <p>
                Note that it is very unlikely I could actually get through all
                of these considerations in a design interview due to time
                constraints (Stripe’s system design interview is only 45
                minutes), but laying out the process and not finishing due to
                time has value. Lay out a framework, follow it loosely,
                highlighting some considerations so the interviewer can
                understand that you have breadth because you have a framework
                but also depth because they get concrete examples to cite.
              </p>
              <h3 id="correctness"><a href="#correctness">Correctness</a></h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Agree on terminology with the interviewer. For example, what
                  do you mean when you say “cache”? Is it a distributed or
                  in-memory cache? Does it have a TTL? If you are drawing
                  diagrams, have a shared understanding of what the boxes and
                  lines represent. (As an interviewer, I often assist scattered
                  candidates by restating what I believe they are saying.)
                </li>
                <li>
                  Focus on simplicity. This is the stage where you are making
                  the simplest thing possible.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Model domain complexity precisely. Candidates often try to
                  over-abstract or expand the scope of a system too early and
                  design a floor wax that is also a dessert topping. Do not get
                  side tracked solving tangent problems.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Demonstrate end to end understanding of critical flows. Prove
                  that you have the simplest design that meets the requirements
                  by walking through the important data flows step by step.

                  Identify which components will fall over first due to load.
                  Discuss options for horizontal and vertical scaling. Adding
                  more hosts might require being more stateless and/or
                  introducing eventual consistency.

                  Consider duplicating infrastructure in multiple regions or
                  data centers. Within each region have multiple copies of each
                  system component. (This is much easier now that SPOFs are
                  dealt with.) Identify areas where batching or aggregation are
                  appropriate. If you are starting to introduce caches, consider
                  how they will be populated. (Maybe pre-populate them.)

                  Now that we have mapped so much out in the previous steps, we
                  can consider scale properly and modify requirements. Often
                  there is no way to scale further than to drop or loosen
                  guarantees or invariants. (Moving things async, eventual
                  consistency, less reliability for non-critical tasks, priority
                  tiers.)

                  With so many nodes in a distributed system you might delve
                  into how you might handle service discovery, access control,
                  and cryptography (public key infrastructure (PKI), network
                  meshes (m/TLS)) if your system has particular needs in these
                  areas.

                  Describe what we can do to ensure the system works as we

                  Design the system for the organization it is built for. How is
                  ownership of different aspects of the system managed? As the
                  system evolves, who should be making the changes? How are
                  engineers properly incentivized to keep the system healthy?

              <p>
                System design interviews can be really awesome. As an
                interviewer, the interview is so much more dynamic and engaging
                than pass-or-fail code exercises. For candidates, these
                interviews can be quite stressful and daunting. Most interview
                processes are poorly designed and executed to really understand
                someone’s capabilities–it is a hard problem with time
                constraints after all.
              </p>
              <p>
                Here I have laid out my definition of the essence of an
                excellent, time-constrained system design:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Design the simplest thing first, then expand upon it.</li>
                <li>
                  Design for the right problem, stakeholders, and outcomes.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Present a clear narrative of how you go about designing the
                  system.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                As an interviewer, I want to be coming out of the interview
                knowing the candidate has done all these things so it is to your
                advantage to facilitate that.
              </p>
              <p>
                The interview process is two sided, the employer assesses you
                and you assess the employer. Design interviews will be run
                differently. The important meta point to take away from this
                article is, “Does this approach to assessing a system design as
                an interviewer and this approach to designing systems as a
                candidate resonate with you?”
              </p>
              <p>
                If it does, I recommend taking some of the advice here and
                applying it on both sides of the table if possible. It would
                really make the industry a better place in my opinion.
              </p>
              <p>
                If it doesn’t, what does? Consider both sides of the table, what
                you would assess and how you could best perform well by your
                measure. And most importantly let me know!
