                Locality is a measure of where code is organized and how it is
                interacted with. It's an important dimension to writing good
                code as it's the largest factor in development velocity.
              </p>
              <p>
                In general, you want good locality between relevant pieces of
                code. It's like writing a good story: you explain things in a
                certain order and a series of events are located in the same
                chapter. However, in a sufficiently large code base, not
                everything can be local and you would not want it to be anyway:
                too many things are hard to reason about. The story would be too
                long and you don't have time to read it all.
              </p>
              <h2 id="placement"><a href="#placement">Placement</a></h2>
              <p>
                Locality at a more &quot;physical&quot; level is how things are
                grouped:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Similar methods are grouped together within a section of a
                  file
                </li>
                <li>Similar sections are grouped into a file</li>
                <li>Similar files are grouped in a directory</li>
                <li>
                  Similar directories are grouped into a package, repo, and so
                  on
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                The elephant in the room is “what does similar mean?” There are
                two trains of thought:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Group by type of thing</li>
                <li>Group by feature or concern</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Supposing we have a simple app with users logging in and
                checking their bank balance, if we were to group by type of
                thing we'd have:
              </p>
              <pre><code>my-app/
  models/
    user
    user_session
    bank_account
    balance_entries
  views/
    login
    logout
    balance_page
  servers/
    primary
</code></pre>
              <p>And this same structure grouped by feature we'd have:</p>
              <pre><code>my-app/
  authentication/
    user
    user_session
    login
    logout
  banking
    bank_account
    balance_entries
    balance_page
  servers/
    primary
</code></pre>
              <p>
                In this feature (or “concern”) case, you'll notice that
                <code>servers</code> remain the same as presumably the server is
                hosting both the authentication and the banking features. It
                does not distinctly belong in one or the other. In each style
                there will be things that don't all fit into neat boxes.
              </p>
              <p>But let's compare these two approaches:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    Grouping by type of thing, it's immediately obvious how many
                    things of each type there are. For example, we can plainly
                    see there are 4 models. However, with all models placed in
                    the same folder, it is hard to conceptually drive a wedge
                    between how models are used and how they ought to interact.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    Grouping by feature, it's immediately clear that
                    <code>user_session</code> is for authentication and
                    <code>balance_entry</code> is for banking. However, what is
                    a model and what is a view we cannot be certain.
                  </p>
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                When we consider change management, the &quot;type of
                thing&quot; approach is generally more optimal for the
                &quot;type of thing&quot; team to work on: everything they need
                to touch regarding the big picture of models is in one place.
                It's easier to make sweeping changes to all models and oversee
                their usages. The feature approach is more optimal for feature
                developers as the elements that compose into a useful feature
                are in one place and can be iterated on is lockstep. Ideally if
                an entire feature is made obsolete, you can simply delete the
                feature's folder and move on.
              </p>
              <p>
                There's an inherent struggle here on which locality scheme is
                optimal. In my experience which style is adopted in a given
                situation is oriented around the organization of people working
                on the code. An infrastructure team will naturally bias towards
                the &quot;type of thing&quot; they are responsible for: this
                code structure is neat and orderly for them. A product team will
                group by feature as that's how they iterate: building feature
                after feature, some succeed and some fail. They are primarily
                responsible for producing value, not organizing things such that
                they can steward a single feature long term or maintain it
                indefinitely.
              </p>
              <p>
                I recommend a balanced approach here where infrastructure teams
                and product teams are catered to. The reasoning:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    <strong>Product teams are nomadic.</strong> Once a feature
                    is built, they move on. This is optimal: innovation comes
                    from chasing, taking risks, and failing. With this mobility
                    and churn, knowledge transfer breaks down more readily:
                    people come and go and don't understand the things that have
                    been built. As such you want to allow product teams the
                    liberty to isolate features and draw proper boundaries.
                    Those isolated features that do succeed tend to be easier
                    for infrastructure teams to adopt and champion.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    <strong>Infrastructure teams grind.</strong> All those
                    successful features become entrenched and hard to change.
                    Strewn throughout a codebase with no way to grok the big
                    picture and make cross-feature changes to these common types
                    of things leaves infrastructure teams in a tough spot. They
                    may not be able to dig themselves out of a hole and in the
                    meantime product teams working in isolation in aggregate
                    exacerbate the problems. In order for infrastructure teams
                    to keep pace with product teams, they need to be trailing
                    but not too far behind.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    <strong>Culture and leadership are major factors.</strong>
                    Leaders who value features and won't see the value in
                    infrastructure see developer velocity grind to halts.
                    Leaders who allow the infrastructure to always be tip-top
                    never see features. Interestingly, in these environments,
                    the best engineers are often running the unspoken
                    counter-culture: incremental releases of features and
                    continual, strategic investment in velocity. This is the
                    balanced approach.
                  </p>
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                A balanced approach to the above, in which you can enable both
                styles to coexist, looks like:
              </p>
              <pre><code>my-app/
  authentication/
    models/
      user
      user_session
    views/
      login
      logout
  banking
    models/
      bank_account
      balance_entries
    views/
      balance_page
  servers/
    primary
</code></pre>
              <p>
                We can build tools to observe code structured in this format
                using both product and infrastructure lenses. We treat the
                <code>authentication</code> and <code>banking</code> directories
                as features (more commonly called modules or packages), modeling
                them as a &quot;type of thing.&quot; We build tooling to support
                introspecting these features in aggregate, e.g. &quot;Give me a
                list of all the features.&quot;
              </p>
              <p>
                This serves as a starting point to drive a consistent structure
                within features. For example, enforce that all models must live
                in the <code>${feature}/models</code> directory. Now we can get
                all of the models by querying for all models within each
                feature. In this case, product teams write against a prescribed
                pattern but otherwise code how they want to model and work out a
                problem. And infrastructure teams can still understand the big
                picture and make sweeping changes across models as they need.
              </p>
              <p>
                At a macro-level code locality is an approximation of the
                organization of people which maintain the code. Expect the
                optimal locality to change over a feature's lifetime.
              </p>
              <h2 id="immediacy"><a href="#immediacy">Immediacy</a></h2>
              <p>Code locality is an optimization problem of:</p>
              <ol>
                <li>Make code easier to find.</li>
                <li>
                  Make code easier to read. (If you can't find it, you can't
                  read it.)
                </li>
                <li>
                  Make code easier to change. (If you can't read it, good luck
                  changing it.)
                </li>
              </ol>
              <p>
                Logical and consistent grouping, in addition to search tools,
                make finding code much easier than without. This is the
                fundamental prerequisite to any development not starting from
                scratch. That grouping aids in reading: it's the difference
                between reading a chaotic novel and a beloved short story. And
                finally, accomplishing a change in a single grouping is much
                easier than making a single change in dozens of disparate
                places.
              </p>
              <p>
                But great code locality is not merely about the right place. It
                is also about the right time. Discovery, readability, and
                iteration can be aided by a spectrum of tools and engineers
                ought to be diligent and mindful of taking advantage of them.
              </p>
              <p>Here's a list of assistive tools sorted from best to worse:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Auto-complete</li>
                <li>Type-checking</li>
                <li>Tests</li>
                <li>Code comments</li>
                <li>Documentation</li>
                <li>Human assistance</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                The &quot;right time&quot; with regard to code locality is
                almost always as soon as possible. Auto-complete helps you type,
                type-checking helps you as you type (in most interactive
                development environments (IDEs)), tests help you as you save
                changes locally (if they are fast enough (so make them fast)).
                Code comments, documentation, and other humans help provide
                context not encoded (and perhaps outdated); each being
                progressively slower to find/use.
              </p>
              <p>
                One instance in which timeliness of code locality should not be
                ASAP is when it results in an intractable proliferation of
                options. So called &quot;over-choice&quot; is a burden and
                distraction as it presents the developer new problems to solve,
                not solutions to their problems.
              </p>
              <p>
                Another instance in which ASAP timeliness is not optimal is when
                it creates poor code quality. A common example of this is the
                abuse of code-generation tools. Often engineers struggle to
                properly encode a comprehensive and minimal interface and resort
                to generating massive amounts of boilerplate code. This is a
                form of auto-complete which can be actively harmful, littering a
                code base with inconsistency and noise that can be difficult to
                claw back. Helping fellow engineers write bad code faster is not
                worth doing. More timely and easy to use tools must create
                positive feedback loops.
              </p>
              <p>
                Leveraging code locality on this dimension is a potential boon
                for every engineer:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    For product engineers, a more precise modeling and shorter
                    feedback loops lead to faster development and fewer bugs.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    For infrastructure engineers, leveraging these tools makes
                    the features they support more self-service; freeing them up
                    to support product teams in more domains.
                  </p>
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                However, the rub is leveraging these assistive tools generally
                takes more of an engineer's immediate time. You would not want
                to build a collection of auto-complete snippets for something
                that turns out to never be used. You must be judicious in
                deciding at what rung you ought to help yourself and fellow
                developers compared to delivering the features themselves.
              </p>
              <p>
                This is yet again a place where I recommend the balanced
                approach: incremental releases of features and continual,
                strategic investment in velocity.
              </p>
              <p>
                Infrastructure teams do well to allow product teams to try a
                bunch of things, see what sticks, and then encode and elevate
                the victors. Product teams do well to explicitly model and
                encode the domain they are working in such that they succeed in
                building features. This is why we see strong engineering
                cultures enforce bare minimums, for example, that all code must
                have tests or that all code must have type annotations.
              </p>
              <hr />
              <p>
                Locality is a balancing act in two aspects: placement and
                timeliness.
              </p>
              <p>
                In regards to placement, the correct approach is a trade off of
                who to cater to, e.g. who is the audience. Above we juxtaposed
                infrastructure and product teams, but we can have many more
                audiences than that: non-technical people (e.g. needing to
                introspect/audit the system) and even computers and the
                technical limitations they present us (e.g. constraints of
                hardware and distributed systems).
              </p>
              <p>
                For timeliness, we weigh investing in velocity versus features.
                We consider the tools at our disposal to help us write code
                faster and better.
              </p>
              <p>
                In each dimension, moderation and incremental, continual
                investment is the best path forward between possible extremes.
