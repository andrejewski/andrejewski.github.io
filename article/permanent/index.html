                &quot;Yeah. That's kinda my thing.&quot;<br />
                &quot;I don't believe you.&quot;<br />
                &quot;I'm shocked. Look, you aren't the first and won't be the
                last.&quot; She reached under the table into her bag.
                &quot;Here, please save me the trouble of explaining.&quot;
              </p>
              <p>
                The book cover read &quot;Why I Can't Die: As You Soon Will
                Understand This Is A Partial Memoir.&quot; The customer jerked
                back on comprehension of it. &quot;Don't try and swindle me into
                buying your book!&quot;<br />
                &quot;Oh, no, you can have this for free. That book has been out
                of print for like four decades.&quot;<br />
                &quot;...Decades?&quot;
              </p>
              <p>
                She paused to reflect on how recent it still felt. Back at
                attention, she continued, &quot;Never mind. You take this
                book.&quot;<br />
                &quot;Butâ€“&quot;<br />
                &quot;I've got boxes of them at home. I always carry one around
                with me just for this very social interaction. Go ahead, take
                it.&quot;<br />
                &quot;I don't like to read.&quot;<br />
                &quot;Fine, there's a video documentary on Huâ€“&quot; A stutter
                jerked her back into her inner monologue, &quot;Of all of the
                streaming service from my first lifetime to survive, it had to
                be the one with a stupid name.&quot;<br />
                &quot;It's on Hulu. You can watch that.&quot;<br />
                &quot;How long is it?&quot;<br />
                &quot;Can I be honest with you?&quot;<br />
                &quot;Surâ€“&quot;<br />
                &quot;Fuck you. I mean, again, not the first but you have some
                nerve walking over to my table to interrogate me. And then I try
                to explain everything and you didn't actually care
                anyway?&quot;<br />
                &quot;Now wait justâ€“actually no, you're right. Sorry to force a
                conversation like this. My friend over at the table back there
                insisted you were immortal and I guess I threw myself into a bit
                of a shock. I'm sorry to have bothered you.&quot;<br />
                &quot;Oh, well, it's alright. I do get this a lot.&quot;<br />
                &quot;It's just that you're so composed about it?&quot;<br />
                &quot;Being the only immortal person in the world? I'm
                particularly suited to have had adequate time to come to terms
                with my situation.&quot;<br />
                &quot;Yes, I suppose. I will take that book if I may?&quot;<br />
                &quot;Sure.&quot;<br />
                &quot;And I'll watch that documentary if I ever get a Hulu
                subscription.&quot;<br />
                &quot;You know some things never change.&quot;<br />
                &quot;Excuse me?&quot;<br />
                &quot;Oh, nothing. The documentary is alright and all, but a
                Hulu subscription isn't worth it. The book has more
                details.&quot;<br />
                &quot;Just the book then. Thank you. Have a nice day.&quot;<br />
                &quot;You too, dude.&quot;

                and outmaneuver those he challenged. This went on for quite some
                time, always pushing his limits.
              </p>
              <p>
                He found himself stuck in a rut, completely unbeatable. With the
                world at his feet and no worthy challengers, he thought back to
                his most worthy rivals. If there was no one who could compete
                still alive, could reviving one who had seen their fate end give
                them an unforeseen edge? Something to inject excitement and
                challenge into his blasÃ© existence?
              </p>
              <p>
                He found an obsession in making this a reality. Funneling
                everything he had into it, he engineered a way to bring people
                back to life. From the unmarked grave he had made, he retrieved
                the greatest rival he had ever known. Her corpse arrived in his
                lab and he got to work.
              </p>
              <p>
                The machines worked. She had been successfully revived. She was
                placed in a standalone hospital room and when she finally was
                conscious, the strategist came to meet her once again. He would
                explain what was going on, why he chose to resurrect her, and
                beg her to compete with him once more.
              </p>
              <p>
                Unfortunately, she explained she had no memory of her past life.
                In shock, he sat at her bedside in silence. He did explain
                everything in hopes of jogging her memory, but to no avail. She
                stayed in the room for a few days, waiting for the memories to
                come back but they never did. This was reasonable: she had been
                dead for several months. That her decayed body could be repaired
                enough to allow life to be reawakened was an impossible feat to
                pull off.
              </p>
              <p>
                After some time, she asked to leave. The strategist, maximally
                despondent, agreed. She left his laboratory and set out to make
                a life for herself yet again.
              </p>
              <hr />
              <p>
                &quot;Honey, I gave another book away!&quot; she shouted up the
                stairs as she entered the house.
              </p>
              <p>
                His voice was faint from this distance but she could make out,
                &quot;Oh, that's great?&quot; Her husband managed to shout back
                but still carry a sarcastic, melodramatic, and yet monotone
                voice.
              </p>
              <p>
                She met him at the top of the stairs, &quot;This one did catch
                himself though. Only a handful apologize for their behavior in
                their first encounter.&quot;<br />
                &quot;I guess it's good news then. Soon enough we'll only have a
                dozen boxes left.&quot;<br />
                &quot;Once those are gone we'll have enough room for an extra
                monitor.&quot;<br />
                &quot;But without the stockpile how are you going to keep your
                bewildered, complete stranger fans at bay?&quot;<br />
                &quot;Then maybe it will be time for a second edition.&quot;<br />
                &quot;Oh? I thought you said writing the first book was painful
                enough.&quot;<br />
                &quot;Well, it is a <em>partial</em> memoir. Maybe every two
                hundred years or so, I'd like to think I've accumulated enough
                of something worth sharing.&quot;<br />
                &quot;I would hope so,&quot; he said cheekily.<br />
                &quot;Besides, everyone always clamors for the origin story
                anyway. I sprinkle on a few chapters from the modern day, make
                some easy money, and keep the book in circulation and acquire
                myself a few dozen boxes of copiesâ€“&quot;<br />
                &quot;Seems like a good, repeatable plan.&quot;<br />
                &quot;Well, slow down. It's not like youâ€“I'm sorry.&quot;
              </p>
              <p>
                He took a seat next to her, &quot;We've discussed that enough. I
                love you.&quot;<br />
                &quot;I know.&quot;<br />
                &quot;So, will I make the cut? Do you think we'll be able to
                squeeze out a chapter of our own for this second
                edition?&quot;<br />
                &quot;When the first edition came out, I received a lot of flak
                that it was watered down. People couldn't handle the premise let
                alone the details of it.&quot;<br />
                &quot;But you did water it down. Right?&quot;<br />
                &quot;Of course. As much as my book is special to humanity as an
                account of an abnormality, this is my life. And not everything
                in my life I can share.&quot;<br />
                &quot;I want you to share what you want.&quot;
              </p>
              <p>
                There was a long silence. Glances were exchanged and she reached
                to dim the lights. &quot;Ready for bed?&quot;<br />
                &quot;So the third edition then?&quot;<br />
                &quot;Huh?&quot;<br />
                &quot;If you write about us in the third edition, I won't be
                able to call you on your bullshit.&quot;<br />
                &quot;Precisely.&quot;
              </p>
              <p>They both laughed and made their way to the bedroom.</p>
              <hr />
              <p>
                Without a memory of her past, she couldn't well grasp how much
                had changed since she passed away. If it had truly been a few
                months then not much should have changed. Nothing about the
                outside world felt irregular now that she was back to it. That
                was a comfort.
              </p>
              <p>
                When she was revived she had memories. How to breath, how to
                eat, to cook, and speak her primary language. She was told in
                her past life she would sometimes casually drift between
                speaking two other languages when she was intimidating people.
                &quot;What a girl she must have been,&quot; she thought. She'd
                lost some amount of herself and couldn't say how much or how
                little.
              </p>
              <p>
                She wasn't socially inept based on some encounters with the
                truly awkward. But she definitely did not boast a sharp tongue
                and a sharper wit like she envisioned her old self having. It
                was bittersweet that there wasn't much to remind her of her old
                self beyond what the strategist shared. She had a clean slate:
                no family or friends to return to, nothing to her name, and not
                even that. She had no real name, just her business alias. This
                woman she used to be, was she happy to be this adrift and alone,
                or was there more to her story than what she knew? She couldn't
                remember.
              </p>
              <p>
                It wasn't long before she returned to the laboratory. She had
                lost the memory of how restricted life was in the world without
                an identity. She had lasted a few days on the random charity of
                others who didn't mind helping a girl that wouldn't explain her
                situation. It wasn't going to work long-term, her most recent
                host explained. She would need to re-integrate with society and
                that took more knowhow than she had.
              </p>
              <p>
                The strategist obliged. He had resurrected her so he was
                directly responsible for helping get her life back on track.
                Maybe. She appreciated the help and his conviction but
                questioned whether it was genuine. After all, he did kill her
                previous self in some &quot;spectacular fashion.&quot; A failed
                result like her seemed to pose a risk surely. And yet he helped:
                he called favors to insert her into the right databases, give
                her new documents, and a new name.
              </p>
              <p>
                In exchange, she worked part-time in the laboratory. She was
                kept busy with mostly sorting and data entry tasks. She had
                gleaned that another resurrection was planned. As unfortunate a
                fate it was to not be able to dance with his greatest foe, the
                strategist believed second best might make due. Once the
                administrative work of building her new identity was complete,
                she was given a small sum of cash and set out again. Her new
                life had officially begun this time.
              </p>
              <hr />
              <p>
                There was a light knock on the door before it opened. &quot;I
                never thought we'd replace those boxes with a desk up
                here.&quot;<br />
                &quot;Don't worry. It's only temporary. We will have new boxes
                in no time.&quot;<br />
                &quot;Well don't rush. As much as people used to like your first
                book, you've gotta keep the second edition good enough to be
                published.&quot;<br />
                &quot;My publisher had the same concern. Here I thought I had
                thunder trapped in a bottle, but I guess today's audiences are
                less taken aback by me. I'm not sure how to feel about
                it.&quot;<br />
                &quot;Don't worry, you're still a weirdo.&quot;<br />
                &quot;Too commonplace to make a buck and just still incessantly
                scrutinized. What a pickle.&quot;<br />
                &quot;How's it coming along?&quot;<br />
                &quot;Like the first time, I have all of the material I want to
                cover. Framing in the right words just takes time. Sometimes I
                channel my past self, a show women, a storyteller.&quot;<br />
                &quot;Must be a lot to juggle.&quot;<br />
                &quot;Yeah, my body may be immortal but my memory is limited
                just like everyone else's. It's a good thing I still have the
                first edition to jog my memory of all the way back
                then.&quot;<br />
                &quot;Not exactly the best source of truth though?&quot;<br />
                &quot;What else can I do? I can only add.&quot;<br />
                &quot;Is that what you want to do? Money's no driver for you
                like it used to be, you can take chances.&quot;<br />
                &quot;Do you think enough time has passed?&quot;<br />
                &quot;Depends. Whatever gas you have left in the tank of this
                origin story, you can share it with me if you want. Otherwise,
                if it's too much for the second edition it's hard for me to
                say.&quot;
              </p>
              <p>
                She shuffled some papers around, signaling the change in
                subject. &quot;What would you want to know in the new chapters,
                if you had only just read the first parts?&quot;<br />
                &quot;Remember my first question I asked when I finished reading
                it?&quot;<br />
                &quot;I do. I'm not sure I'm ready.&quot;<br />
                &quot;Can I be honest?&quot;<br />
                &quot;Of course.&quot;<br />
                &quot;You know I've never really cared for your hesitation in
                your writing. I understand your predicament here as the only one
                able to give life to your condition, that you want the world to
                know and understand. But I don't think you can achieve your goal
                by redacting so much. People will understand more than nothing,
                but nothing real.&quot;<br />
                &quot;And so why bother?&quot;<br />
                &quot;Whatever pressure the first edition was under, you
                shouldn't feel it now. Everyone you could have hurt is
                gone.&quot;<br />
                &quot;I'm not.&quot;<br />
                &quot;That's true. But are half truths all you want to
                write?&quot;<br />
                &quot;Maybe that's all I remember.&quot;<br />
                &quot;You don't act like it.&quot;
