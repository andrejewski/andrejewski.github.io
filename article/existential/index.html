              <p>
                I was sitting at an empty table in the middle of the room. There
                were no doors or windows. Lights lined the edges of the space,
                letting me know there was no obvious way out. I had briefly
                gotten up from my chair to inspect things closely. What I found
                notable beside the silence was the lack of sharp edges on the
                furniture. It was perfectly smooth leaving no chance for self
                harm for those who had to wait in here.
              </p>
              <p>
                The chairs and table were molded to the floor. I removed my feet
                from the table once I had tried just about every position. The
                chair did no favors either. I waited for what felt like hours,
                but it could have been minutes.
              </p>
              <p>
                At last, the wall across from me decompressed and raised. A man
                in a suit entered. He asked my name.
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Robert Retrich,&quot; I responded.</p>
              <p>
                He hardly gave me a glance before saying, &quot;Apologies, I
                must have the wrong room.&quot; He left. The wall closed up
                again and I continued to wait for something to happen. There was
                no gum under the table. I began to pace around the room.
              </p>
              <p>
                On my seventy-sixth lap around the table, a man's voice came
                over a speaker, &quot;Could you stop and sit down please? You're
                making me dizzy.&quot; I hadn't noticed a speaker placed
                anywhere. The sound seemed to be coming from the center of the
                ceiling.
              </p>
              <p>
                I complied and sat back down. &quot;Can someone come and talk to
                me? I'm really bored.&quot;
              </p>
              <p>
                A long silence lasted for a few minutes, but the voice did
                eventually return. &quot;I apologize for the wait. Do you need
                any food or water?&quot;
              </p>
              <p>
                &quot;A water would be great,&quot; I admitted. The room seemed
                to lack any humidity.
              </p>
              <p>
                &quot;Give me a moment.&quot; I could hear the man behind the
                voice getting up from his chair wherever he was.
              </p>
              <p>
                A few moments later the wall opened again. A man in a security
                officer outfit entered carrying a cup of water. &quot;Here you
                go,&quot; he said gently, confirming he was the voice of the
                ceiling. He quickly exited the room, the door closing behind
                him. The water was lukewarm, but sufficed.
              </p>
              <p>
                At least an hour had passed, with me killing time messing with
                the empty cup. At long last the wall opened. The suited man from
                before had returned.
              </p>
              <p>
                &quot;Mr. Retrich, are you related to a Bob Retrich? I can't
                seem to find him in any of these rooms.&quot;
              </p>
              <p>&quot;I go by Bob.&quot; I started to inhale.</p>
              <p>
                &quot;You said your name was Robert?&quot; I continued to
                inhale.
              </p>
              <p>
                &quot;Roberts can also be called Bobs,&quot; I said, trying my
                hardest to maintain all of the oxygen I had crammed into my
                lungs.
              </p>
              <p>
                The man let out a deep sigh, which I matched with an even more
                obnoxiously loud sigh from all the air I had built up. I
                prodded, &quot;Dude, what the hell? This is common
                knowledge.&quot;
              </p>
              <p>The man entered and took a seat across from me.</p>
              <p>
                &quot;Well I do apologize for all that. I did not intend to keep
                you waiting this long. I see at least you did get some
                water.&quot;
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Yeah. Can you tell me what's going on here?&quot;</p>
              <p>
                &quot;Earth is gone. This room is inside a large spaceship. I am
                an alien. You are one of a few dozen survivors. My species will
                help you colonize a new planet. We wish to research you in
                greater detail there.&quot;
              </p>
              <p>
                I leaned forward in my chair. The man looked normal to me. I
                stared daggers at him to call his bluff. He stared back at me,
                blankly at first, but as the minutes passed he developed a more
                concerned look on his face.
              </p>
              <p>&quot;You want proof, yes?&quot;</p>
              <p>&quot;Ah huh.&quot;</p>
              <p>
                The floor sunk. It felt as though the room were an elevator. We
                descended a story down and then the walls became transparent,
                the clearest glass I have seen. The man gestured over my right
                shoulder towards the bottom corner of the room. I turned to see
                what looked like Earth, shattered into three pieces. One with
                the moon embedded in its crust.
              </p>
              <p>
                My eyes returned to the man. It took less time for him to catch
                on to my meaning this time.
              </p>
              <p>&quot;You need more proof?&quot;</p>
              <p>Daggers.</p>
              <p>
                &quot;I shall show you my true form.&quot; He stood, keeping his
                eyes locked with mine. He seemed a good sport. Removing his suit
                revealed tentacles lining his sides. He tugged at each one,
                causing them to shrivel up. With the last tentacle plucked, the
                front of what must have been his chest plate fell open.
              </p>
              <p>
                I propped myself up to get a better look inside but the chest
                cavity began to release a thick fog. It pulsated flashes of
                various colors as it began to take shape over the table. The gas
                shaped into a perfected smooth ball, twice the size of a beach
                ball. The vibrance of colors normalized to a light brown.
              </p>
              <p>
                Without warning the gas solidified and plummeted down, denting
                the table. The solid reminded me of feces as it began to develop
                cracks and creases across its top. From the creases a multitude
                of buds began to spawn. The buds grew flowers which quickly
                bloomed to reveal jagged thorns along their stems. The thorns
                began to pierce other stems forming a networking of
                interconnected flowers.
              </p>
              <p>
                The flowers turned crimson red andâ€“&quot;Okay, I get it. You are
                an alien. It checks out.&quot;
              </p>
              <p>
                &quot;I'm..not..done..&quot; the bouquet now radiating with an
                intense heat managed to murmur.
              </p>
              <p>
                &quot;Well I am. Let's get this show on the road already.&quot;
              </p>
              <p>
                The flowers cooled down to a calm blue color. A hole took shape
                in the bottom of the poop ball. It was a mouth.
              </p>
              <p>
                &quot;Alright then. You have been selected as the representative
                of your species. We plan to arrive at the home of your new
                colony in what you would call a fortnightâ€“&quot;
              </p>
              <p>
                &quot;How did you not know 'Bob' was short for 'Robert'!?&quot;
                I shouted, caught up in certainly the wrong detail of what the
                alien had just said. Him knowing that obscure unit of measure
                instead really ticked me off.
              </p>
              <p>
                &quot;Again, I apologize.&quot; He got back on track,
                &quot;Fourteen of your days from now we will arrive on your
                planet's replacement. In exchange, we will research you to
                further our understanding.&quot;
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Alright, whatever. Can I ask you a question?&quot;</p>
              <p>&quot;Go ahead.&quot;</p>
              <p>&quot;What's the meaning of life?&quot;</p>
              <p>
                &quot;You will be kept alive on this ship and transported to the
                planet safely. The rest is up to you.&quot;
              </p>
              <p>
                &quot;No, what is the meaning of life, in the general
                case?&quot;
              </p>
              <p>
                &quot;I'm not sure what you mean. As you've seen we don't know
                how to fully speak your language.&quot;
              </p>
              <p>
                &quot;I was born. I will eventually die. What is the
                purpose?&quot;
              </p>
              <p>
                &quot;We don't have a record of what you were assigned to do on
                your planet?&quot;
              </p>
              <p>
                &quot;No, I'm not talking about just me. Life, consciousness,
                what is the point? Why do you exist?&quot;
              </p>
              <p>
                The ball looked as confused as a ball could be. Silence lingered
                until I asked, &quot;can you sprout some eyes?&quot;
              </p>
              <p>
                The mud above the mouth began to swirl two puddles which took
                shape as eyes. I looked into them just like before, daggers out.
                The eyes looked back as I strained.
              </p>
              <p>
                &quot;Fuck. You guys haven't even thought about this, have
                you?&quot;
              </p>
              <p>
                &quot;Your question is confusing to me, yes. I shall ask others
                if they can make sense of this. Do you have any other
                questions?&quot;
              </p>
              <p>
                &quot;No I don't. This question is really important to my kind.
                I was hoping you could shed some light on it. Everything else we
                can figure out another time.&quot;
              </p>
              <p>
                &quot;Very well. Please follow me to your sleeping
                quarters.&quot;
              </p>
              <p>
                The mud ball swayed side to side, uprooting itself from the dent
                in the table. Out of the hole, its body cracked into fragments
                which spilled off the edge of the table. Those pieces shuffled
                toward the man suit, huddling at the feet, building a tower to
                reach up to the chest cavity. I waited at the wall while it did
                all this reconstruction.
              </p>
              <p>
                Finally we entered the hallway. I was escorted only a few steps
                to a door on the other side of the hall. This was my room,
                nothing special inside. A table, single chair, and bed with a
                blanket. An inner door led to a small bathroom which had a
                shower and sink. I asked about a toilet and mud said I could go
                anywhere and it would be disposed of automatically. I insisted
                on a toilet and he promised it would be installed shortly.
              </p>
              <p>
                I crawled into bed and went to sleep pretty quickly. It had
                certainly been a longer day than most. I dreamed about the cup I
                left in theâ€“
              </p>
              <p>
                &quot;What the fuck did you do!?&quot; My eyes shot open as my
                body slammed the ceiling. I had been shoved into the top corner
                just above the bed by an arm of vines. They shackled around me,
                gripping me to the ceiling way too tightly.
              </p>
              <p>
                The plant monster shouted again, &quot;What the fuck is going
                on!?&quot;
              </p>
              <p>
                &quot;Oh my god,&quot; I said. &quot;Y'all really haven't
                thought about it.&quot;
              </p>
              <p>
                &quot;Thought about what? Answer me,&quot; the plant demanded,
                it's grip growing tighter.
              </p>
              <p>
                &quot;Can you handle it?&quot; I foolishly asked as if it could
                give me a genuine answer with what little information it must
                have had.
              </p>
              <p>
                The consequence for that miscommunication was both my arms.
                Sliced right off by razor sharp vines. The pain was too
                overwhelming and I rag dolled just as I caught a glimpse of
                blood spurting in the sides of my peripheral vision.
              </p>
              <p>
                Then I remember only brief flashes. I remember looking down to
                see my stubs bandaged. I remember being dragged by my legs, my
                feet encased like within concrete. Hallways, flashing lights,
                and blaring alarms were ever present in these few memories. My
                inner pain allowed me to shut out the noise, but the vibrations
                and unsteadiness were unescapable.
              </p>
              <p>
                When I came back to full consciousness, I was hunched over
                sitting with my back to a wall. I was a lab rat, surrounded on
                the other three sides by something like plexiglass. I kicked one
                leg out, motioning for attention.
              </p>
              <p>
                &quot;We underestimated you.&quot; The mud approached the glass
                wearing his suit, his voice unmistakable based on the hand full
                of voices I had heard before. &quot;Allow me to explain to you
                the situation.&quot;
              </p>
              <p>
                &quot;After our meeting, I submitted my report to my superiors.
                An hour after the report had reached the elder council, the
                elders had died. Another two hours passed and in that time, 1%
                of our population had died. You were woken, healed, and placed
                in quarantine.&quot;
              </p>
              <p>
                &quot;Look, you have to understandâ€“,&quot; I tried to speak. My
                voice had been taken. I struggled to scream it but nothing came
                out.
              </p>
              <p>
                &quot;Precautions were taken to prevent you from infecting the
                rest of the ship. However, it seems we acted too slowly. We are
                currently in an escaped pod, headed towards what was to be your
                new planet. The main ship is now adrift, in no better shape than
                your home planet. The ship only had pods for half of our
                population and of those pods only a half-dozen were
                released.&quot;
              </p>
              <p>He paused to let me absorb this information.</p>
              <p>
                &quot;I have not been able to contact the other pods. It appears
                the majority of them have damaged hulls, meaning no survivors.
                Unless the remaining pods are in stealth mode out of extreme
                caution, it is safe to say our pod is the last remaining.&quot;
              </p>
              <p>
                More time to absorb. I took this pause to move closer to the
                glass to look into his eyes once again.
              </p>
              <p>
                &quot;In this pod, there are four of us, including you and I.
                Once we land, I shall rebuild my species. In a millennia, we
                will have subsumed the planet to form the basis for a new
                ship.&quot;
              </p>
              <p>
                I put my forehead to the glass, using my daggers to say,
                &quot;and what about me?&quot;
              </p>
              <p>
                He caught my meaning. He stretched to press a button which
                released a door to my left. In unison, two beautiful human girls
                poked their heads out, looking at the mud suit and me, my face
                sticking to the glass wall.
              </p>
              <p>&quot;You, you're golden, Ponyboy.&quot;</p>
              <p>
                &quot;What. The. Fuck!&quot; My voice finally broke free on that
                final word, startling everyone. I was so pissed I literally made
                new chords or something. &quot;An <em>Outsiders</em> reference!?
                How the fuck can you know that but not Bob is Robert, you
                bitch!&quot;
              </p>
              <p>&quot;We arrive in three days.&quot;</p>
