                2018 was a big year for me. One part that turned out to be
                bigger than I anticipated was watching anime.

                Not so impressive until you look at all the other anime I have

              <h1 id="why-i-watch-anime">
                <a href="#why-i-watch-anime">Why I watch anime?</a>
              </h1>
              <p>
                I avoided anime for a long time. Socially, anime was not very
                big in school. People associated it too directly with hentai
                (Japanese porn, I think; I'm not going to search it for you. I
                know hentai means &quot;pervert&quot; so maybe encompassing all
                porn is too wide a net). So I never really heard about new shows
                coming out. It was only after watching Kill la Kill that I
                decided that I liked it enough to explore it.
              </p>
              <p>
                There is a lot I like about anime. Since I draw web comics, I
                enjoy seeing tons of different art styles find their way into
                the animation. From my limited, personal experience, I can
                really appreciate the effort and grinding that goes into these
                productions. The stand outs here are One Punch Man and Mob
                Psycho 100.
              </p>
              <p>
                I like the format: anime are broken into
                <a
                  href="https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/7977/what-is-a-cour"
                  >cours</a
                >
                of around 12 episodes. I like these shorter tracks, as opposed
                to American 24+ episode seasons or something never ending like
                Naruto. This limited runway also makes anime really get to the
                meat faster, very often it is make or break in the first cour so
                it needs to count.
              </p>
              <p>
                The variety of anime is great. American shows have gotten so
                bland: sitcoms, romcoms, crime shows that all blend together and
                are too afraid to go anywhere interesting. Every anime stands
                out in its own way. Looking for an exploration of the female
                perspective of modern work life? Aggretsuko. Looking to
                compensate for being uneducated in anatomy? Cells at Work.
                Looking for a non-stop hype train? Gurren Lagaan.
              </p>
              <p>
                Anime has its niches: Re:zero, Konosuba, and Overlord fall into
                a subgenre called
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isekai">Isekai</a> where
                the main character transferred to a new world. Even in that
                hyper specific niche, these shows are all quite different and
                enjoyable in their own ways. I am also able to explore ideas I
                would otherwise shy away from. Since it is just animation, I can
                also appreciate horror shows like Tokyo Ghoul without getting
                too queazy.
              </p>
              <p>
                I have learned a good amount about Japanese culture from anime.
                It is really unavoidable since America is a secondary consumer.
                That in itself is interesting: so much of what I grew up
                watching was framed by American culture. Anime is probably the
                only non-one-off medium of a different culture I have gotten
                into. As such, I get to see differences in values, priorities,
                and day to day life. Cultural diffusion
                <em>into the US?</em> Good stuff as it turns out.
              </p>
              <p>
                With anime comes its soundtracks. Long story short, I've somehow
                gotten into what I believe is considered J-Po With every new
                anime, I have added at least 1 or 2 good songs to my playlist.
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myth_%26_Roid"
                  >Myth &amp; Roid</a
                >
                in particular caught my attention for great music. I started
                Overlord solely because they made half of Overlord's opening and
                ending songs. I never thought I could enjoy music that I could
                not understand at all, but here I am. At work, anime songs are
                all I listen to. Since I can't understand the lyrics, I can
                listen and continue to focus.
              </p>
              <p>
                Lastly, and this is a little weird to say: I like anime, in
                part, for its openness with sexually. We're talking boobs,
                butts, pretty faces, and more boobs that are thrown in because
                why not. Everyone for the most part is drawn to look their most
                attractive, and it doesn't effect the story. Konosuba isn't
                accidentally putting boob giggles in every 30 seconds, it's
                funny and silly. Anime can explore and poke fun at these more
                adult things, because anime has an audience okay with that.
              </p>
              <p>
                It's part of the culture, not something to be ashamed of. Every
                show has a &quot;best girl,&quot; and it isn't just the one with
                the biggest breasts. I appreciate this transparency and
                collective understanding, which is surely lacking in America.
                Anime culture is genuine and inclusive; that's awesome.

                It is really hard for me to rank anime I have watched this year.
                Just watching an anime to completion does not make me confident
                to compare them. For example, Konosuba I said was &quot;okay,
                kinda funny&quot; my first time through. Re-watching it months
                later, holy crap it is it funny. I have not revisited all these
                anime thoroughly so I won't be ranking them all. I'll rank some
                shows on some aspects instead.

                The show I have gone back and re-watched the most is Kill la
                Kill. It did have a head start being the first anime of the
                year. The Isekai shows come in second: Re:zero, Konosuba, and
                most recent Overlord. These shows all have very compelling and
                interesting characters that I can't help revisit. I have also
                watched Mob Psycho multiple times.

                Gurren Lagaan hit me at the perfect time in my life. This year
                had some big events in my professional career. By the summer, I
                had amassed a lot of responsibility and kept pushing forward,
                wondering what my limit would be. I kept going and by August I
                had found myself accepting my dream job. Gurren synced up
                perfectly, a thrill ride of hype after hype after hype. I can't
                give this anime all the credit, it inspired me to push myself.

                Clear winner is Konosuba. It took me a while but once I finally
                got this show, it got me. This shouldn't be too surprising as
                Konosuba is the most geared toward comedy on the list. Mob
                Psycho 100 definitely is funny too. The big difference I think
                is that Konosuba's humor is always on whereas mid-season Mob got
                a little serious.

              <p>
                Tokyo Ghoul was also interesting and is ongoing, but the initial
                premise kind of got muddled up with action. I think Tokyo Ghoul
                could have taken this easily had it been more melancholy and
                less slashy. Cells at Work is interesting in just how effective
                it is in conveying concepts, but I can't give them credit for
                the human body's complexities.

                Looking at the song counts per anime in my playlist alone, the
                winner is Kill la Kill. Darling in the Franxx and Fullmetal
                Alchemist: Brotherhood are also big contributors. Ultimately
                though, it is Myth &amp; Roid across Re:zero and Overlord that
                stand out the most.

                I know Aggretsuko, One Punch Man, and Mob Psycho 100 will be
                getting new seasons in 2019. One Punch Man in particular I am
                excited for because it has been just so long. Shows where I
                really want new seasons: Re:zero, Konosuba, Overlord (the Isekai
                shows). Overlord is the one I'm least confident in getting more
                support, so please check it out so these great characters don't
                go to waste.
              </p>

                Anyone deeper into anime than myself will notice some glaring
                omissions in my watch history. Shows I have explicitly gone out
                of my way to avoid are My Hero Academia, Attack on Titan, Food
                Wars!, Sword Art Online, and JoJo's Bizarre Adventure. Basically
                ongoing shows with more than 50 episodes are off limits because
                I don't want another Naruto on my hands. This may change in
                2019, but I'll need some convincing. (Yes, I know Fullmetal
                slipped through this year.)
              </p>
              <p>
                I never really plan more than a show ahead, so please give me
                your recommendations if there's something I should be watching.
