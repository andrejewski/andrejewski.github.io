                <li>I know who is using my interface.</li>
                <li>I know what they are using it for.</li>
                <li>I know why they are using it in the way that they are.</li>
              </ol>
              <p>We can roughly map these to common audiences:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Open source: you don't know who is using it, it could be
                  anyone for any reason
                </li>
                <li>
                  A service where users need to register (sign up) to use it:
                  you know who is using it but aren't sure for what
                </li>
                <li>
                  A registered service with good observability into usage: you
                  know who is using it for what, but aren't sure why
                </li>
                <li>
                  Closed, internal system: you know who is using it and for what
                  and why
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                The more fidelity you have, the more flexibility you have to
                meet people's needs. A greater fidelity also implies narrow,
                more situated problems where it is easier to make assumptions.
                For example, within a single company you can say, &quot;I will
                provide data consistency guarantees using [common company
                database].&quot; Whereas with open-source, more often than not
                interfaces must be written agnostic to choice of persistence
                layer.
              </p>
              <p>
                Choosing a lens through which you will serve users is the most
                important aspect to designing an interface.

              <p>
                There is so much a developer is expected to read. It's better to
                design interfaces like documentation doesn't exist. Definitely
                write documentation, but don't use documentation as a crutch
                instead of investing time in making an interface more intuitive.
              </p>
              <p>
                It's important to remember, especially as you get super invested
                and deep into a problem space, that no one else should be
                expected to think that critically. Developers at any level
                copy-and-paste working code and twist it to fit their use case.
                A good interface design acknowledges this and ensures a good
                outcome regardless.
              </p>
              <h1 id="people-dont-write-tests">
                <a href="#people-dont-write-tests">People don't write tests</a>
              </h1>
              <p>
                Such is life. Tests have a cost just like any other piece of
                code. What you believe to be worth testing about using your
                interface won't align with people using it. Don't count on the
                tests of your consumers to give you confidence about your
                interface.
              </p>
              <p>
                Definitely write code that can be tested for those who do. Lower
                the cost of testing by providing test helpers. Orient code in
                such a way that even if people don't write tests now, when it
                comes time to debug or pin functionality down they can. No
                matter how simple or slick an interface, if it can't be tested
                before production it is a nightmare.

                It's okay to not provide a general purpose tool. Especially when
                you're serving a single company, you don't need to be thinking
                about your interfaces like POSIX or duck tape. Not supporting
                the unforeseen is not only fine, it's advantageous.
              </p>
              <p>
                I can't count the number of times that I've prevented bad
                outcomes just by not supporting them.
              </p>
              <p>
                Limiting possibilities introduces friction into other engineers'
                work and brings the discussion to you. While the quote may not
                have been Ford's, &quot;If I had asked people what they wanted,
                they would have said faster horses&quot; resonates with me
                strongly. Having the discussions, asking &quot;what are you
                really trying to do?&quot; gets to the heart of the problems
                developers are facing. Better solutions follow.
              </p>
              <p>
                A more open interface just lets each engineer that uses it
                re-invent in their own bespoke way how to solve the problem at
                hand. These problems more often than not could have a
                well-defined interface and documentation around it.
              </p>
              <p>
                This sounds like forcing user research and it very much is. To
                understand your customers' use cases is the best way to meet
                them.

                There's a counterweight to providing a really great developer
                experience, which is you need to think about the maintainer
                experience as well. If a public interface comes at the cost of
                internal changes being very costly, either:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  The service provided will fail to provide the functionality it
                  promises intermittently as it breaks or not sustain guarantees
                  as it scales.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The maintenance burden will be so great, a new interface will
                  be needed. Having a proliferation of interfaces serving
                  similar purposes is a bad place to be and happens once you've
                  taken on too much debt.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                As the change paralysis sets in internally, external uses also
                inevitably become instant tech debt that will need to be ported
                over to something else some day.
              </p>
              <p>Take the time to understand what a maintainer may want:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  How will someone make future feature additions? Deletions?
                  Scope out some speculative features and take a stab at
                  implementing them.
                </li>
                <li>
                  What mental overhead does your internal design assume and can
                  you reduce it? Phases of refactoring and/or leveraging a type
                  system can help offload the implicit assumptions or make them
                  concrete in the code.
                </li>
                <li>
                  What will give high confidence the system is working over
                  time? Rolling changes to the interface to production should be
                  easy and predictable.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Are consumers of the interface expected to also use other
                  interfaces? Coupling to other behaviors or sources of truth
                  outside a single system can easily become a mess, those touch
                  points also deserve some love even if they are not the primary
                  interface.
                </li>
                <li>
                  What invariants should we lock down upfront while it is
                  easiest to do so? Especially with a brand new interface, be
                  aggressive about providing as little as possible. Fundamental
                  properties are really hard to tack on later as abstractions
                  inevitably leak.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                A good interface that doesn't deliver is worse than a clunky one
                that always does. A great interface can evolve over time to keep
                up with everything else around it.

                Depending on the problem space, there are extents to which
                things can go very wrong. Providing an interface around a
                problem, you want to be thinking about all outcomes, not just
                the good ones.
              </p>
              <p>
                Engineers building on top of your interface won't be writing
                project estimates and deadlines around all the internal failure
                modes of your system. If there's opportunity to introduce more
                friction so they are aware of these concerns, you have choices
                of:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  An extra upfront N hours working out how to build a robust
                  feature.
                </li>
                <li>
                  An extra N hours firefighting issues in production because it
                  wasn't obvious how to build a robust feature.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Remember, we're talking about developer <em>experience</em>.
                Live issues are strictly more stressful to deal with than issues
                that come up in tests before the code is even merged.

              <p>
                I've done a lot of interface design. Open source interfaces,
                where there's so many assumptions you shouldn't make, I've found
                that simply scratching my own itch and designing an interface
                that if it were made by someone else I would use is good enough
                for most small projects. Certainly, open source is supposed to
                be fun and boxing yourself in prematurely can be daunting.
              </p>
              <p>
                When it becomes business, however, I've definitely seen great
                results thinking about the meta-game of interface design. And
                different businesses have different risk appetites. Certainly my
                focus is more on sustainable growth and preventing bad outcomes
                because of the stage Stripe is at. If you're just trying to get
                something working at all, by all means cherry pick!
