                Logical grouping is a common problem in architecting software
                systems. We've got so many names and words for grouping in the
                language of software engineering, it's a bit crazy just how
                little I see it discussed.
              </p>
              <p>
                I primarily want to discuss two themes I've had a passion for
                digging into and understanding.

              </h1>
              <p>
                This is how we design our software as it is to be understood by
                end-users. The quickest example common to almost every business
                application: how we model &quot;users&quot; themselves.
              </p>
              <p>
                In business-to-consumer (B2C) you might choose to model your
                users as each being their own User (mapping to some single
                representation and ID).
              </p>
              <p>
                In business-to-business (B2B), that's not enough: people work
                together therefore you need Organizations as well. Here we have
                to answer a few questions on the relationship these models
                share:
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Can an organization exist without any users?</strong>
                Usually we say, &quot;no, an organization must have at least one
                user (usually the 'organization owner').&quot;
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Can a user belong to multiple organizations?</strong>
                This one is less straight-forward. A user as mapped to a human
                can co-exist and work within multiple organizations. However,
                are we modeling a human or are we modeling a participant in an
                organization? Throw in GDPR, data privacy, and access control
                considerations for good measure. Who owns the data: is the user
                the owner or is the user a contributor to the organization which
                owns the data? If we're modeling humans, can the organization
                modify the user's identity at all, globally, or just in the
                context of that organization?
              </p>
              <p>I'll throw out some examples to answering this question:</p>
              <p>AWS has two types of users:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Root users, the free floating users which have standalone
                  identity with passwords that can access multiple accounts and
                  can own accounts
                </li>
                <li>
                  Account-scoped users, users that only exist within the context
                  of a single account
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Customers pick and choose which model they lean into and how
                aggressively, but AWS steers folks towards the account-scoped
                users and suggests keeping few, well secured root users. No
                accounting for capturing human identity, manage it how you will.
                This is classic AWS: many options, a few right ways, and some
                exceptions and overloaded terms at times.
              </p>
              <p>
                Companies will answer this question primarily based on how they
                start out and whether they've managed to evolve out of their
                initial choice. If you start as a B2C, users map to humans and
                this is an identity containing
                <code>{name, email, birthday}</code>. Then when you find you
                need organizations you have options:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Users are now organizations, you just allow multiple
                  &quot;logins&quot; and eventually those &quot;logins&quot;
                  become the users.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Organizations are created as optional. Some users will be in
                  organizations and some will not. The user that creates an
                  organization will be the owner.
                </li>
                <li>
                  No overlap, a free-floating user cannot participate in an
                  organization. Create an organization, start from scratch as a
                  user in that organization.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>And similarly a B2B moving to support B2C:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  &quot;Users might want to become an organization eventually.
                  Let's create a shadow organization behind the scenes that each
                  user is a part of.&quot;
                </li>
                <li>
                  Organizations are users. Give them profiles and special case
                  when the organization only has a single User.
                </li>
                <li>
                  No overlap. Cut a clean slate and have free-floating users.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Enterprise B2B will often throw more wretches into the mix:
                sub-organizations, then full hierarchies. Basically you can end
                up taking a company's org chart and mapping it to your product.
              </p>
              <p>
                Answering all these modeling questions requires additional
                context and knowing the customers you're working with.
              </p>
              <p>
                If the right answer needs additional context, context that may
                change over time as a business grows, could the wrong answer be
                to pick any particular model?
              </p>
              <p>
                Surely we must start somewhere, so we must pick something. The
                elephant in the room is not all the business strategies or
                customer feedback to sift through to inform a decision, it's all
                the technical debt we take on when building on the wrong model
                of the world.
              </p>
              <p>
                We have a word for this, where changes in one aspect effects or
                inhibits another: coupling. We know this stuff is bad. We slice
                and dice conceptual problems into smaller ones to avoid being
                boxed into a corner. And yet most software we write for business
                applications tends to cling to whatever the user model flavor of
                the time is. Code is riddled with user concerns.
              </p>
              <p>
                This leaves us in tough places, especially in enterprise as more
                and more structure is introduced and we are fighting not just
                with the business problem but how we fit it into our existing
                models to make it easiest for us to deliver just enough until
                the next assumption breaks. This will repeat and repeat, only
                getting more difficult to eventually claw back and restructure.
              </p>
              <h1 id="database-partitioning">
                <a href="#database-partitioning">Database partitioning</a>
              </h1>
              <p>
                Let's look at a lower-level, similar problem: 'at scale'
                databases cannot contain infinite amounts of data. For efficient
                querying, availability, redundancy, etc, you'll eventually need
                to split up one data store into many.
              </p>
              <p>
                Most often the shard key in most systems is the organization,
                user, account, workspace, repository, or some user-understood
                container of resources. It's never quite right, but going from
                no partitioning (as almost everything should start) to some
                partitioning, it is the simplest choice at the moment.
              </p>
              <p>
                However, whatever is chosen to use as the basis for the shard
                key is always wrong for someone. Say you're Twitter and you pick
                users, well some people are incredibly popular and some aren't
                so you've got to find another means to sub-shard per user. Say
                you pick organizations, well again there's always your top X
                organizations doing most of the business. They'll individually
                outsize a single physical database or dislike the notion that
                all their data is stored in a single place from an availability
                perspective.
              </p>
              <p>
                So we're gonna get it wrong no matter what we pick, just like in
                the product modeling situation.
              </p>
              <p>
                Getting it wrong on these two concerns often happens in
                lockstep. A B2B all-in on building features coupled to their
                current notion of organizations will design the database models
                and the sharding scheme (and all related tooling) around the
                current notion of organizations. Everyday development feeds a
                vicious cycle of coupling as it becomes too hard not to couple
                for the average engineer trying to make forward progress.
              </p>
              <p>
                Tooling will be built for the 90% use case and everything that
                doesn't fit the model will need to be custom built.
              </p>
              <p>
                You are fighting a war on two fronts: customers taking your
                product in unforeseen directions, wanting to slice and dice to
                solve their exact problem and reliability pressures on the
                inside as they do it. It's a war of peppering over problems
                half-heartedly and either bending over backwards to meet your
                customers' requirements or solving them kinda / close enough.
              </p>
              <h1 id="decoupling"><a href="#decoupling">Decoupling</a></h1>
              <p>
                The solution is flashing in our faces: solve the coupling
                problems here. Take a page out of the code quality guide:
                enforce strict layers between your code software and the product
                you expose. The email infrastructure doesn't need to know about
                users to send emails. The billing code doesn't need to know
                &quot;customers&quot; map to organizations to charge credit
                cards. Keep software and data agnostic to the business mappings
                and have a thin layer of wiring to connect the two.
              </p>
              <p>
                This seems obvious, but it's not when the bread and butter of
                day to day product development is down the path of this
                coupling. There is a serious momentum to continue down the road
                because the 90% case is well trodden and the objective is to
                build something now, not do what's best for tomorrow.
              </p>
              <p>
                I've found this very friction to be a lot of the work in
                designing systems with these coupling issues. Sometimes I decide
                to lean into the coupling which exacerbates the long-term
                problem but solves an immediate one. Other times, I'm pushing
                the decoupled approach. Having a sense of when to choose is an
                extremely acquired taste, that one need not build up if they
                think about these problems either seriously enough to correct
                course or early enough to not have at all.

              </h2>
              <p>
                I do mention database partitioning in particular here because
                this tends to be the make or break thing for me on whether to
                couple to business models. Consider this situation, when met
                with designing a new system:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  You must design a reliable system. Reliable means no single
                  points of failure, and multiple physical databases perhaps
                  across multiple geographies.
                </li>
                <li>
                  All you have at your disposal is a single shard scheme. Let's
                  say we are partitioning by organization.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The momentum of database tooling and organization is such that
                  you cannot introduce a new shard scheme to be used in this
                  system within the scope of this project.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                In these constraints, an engineer must eat the cost of doing the
                wrong thing to make forward progress.
              </p>
              <p>
                This situation isn't unusual in the evolution of a business. If
                not over-scaling, generally you'll start with no partitioning at
                all and when you first tip your toes into it, reliability has
                already become an indispensable part of new designs. So be wary
                of building too much tooling around the
                business-modeling-coupled shard scheme alone, if you do at all.
                You'll be setting your product development into a vicious cycle.

              <p>
                Aside: I could advocate simplifying product models here, but I
                won't share my biases on that one. To speak on and give advice
                for a generic set of customers and recommend a path forward for
                a business I don't have context on...Understanding customer
                needs is really, really hard and don't escape it.
              </p>
              <p>
                What I can recommend is (1) get used to evolving. Database
                partitioning is one thing that's easy to get entrenched in and
                go far and fast without good, decoupled tooling. Build the
                muscles for data migrations, UI migrations, etc so you're not
                trading off building the right thing versus time to engineer
                given the current debt and how hard it is to pay off.
              </p>
              <p>
                And (2) consider letting your customers evolve themselves. Those
                same muscles you build internally might make sense to reveal
                externally. Database products will sometimes just accept a shard
                key, call it what it is and call it a day. Ask if there's truly
                a competitive advantage in not revealing your hand and letting
                customers build their system inside yours instead of you
                building your system for theirs (and everyone else's).
              </p>
              <p>
                Either in a product or in a system, you can't always know what
                will be best and what's best will change. So maybe let the
                customer define their own logical groupings and get on with
                building nicely decoupled capabilities.
