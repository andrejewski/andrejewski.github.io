              <p>
                It was time for another death bed. My wife and I received the
                news only a few hours before. An office clerk Sam who had
                retired only a few months ago was going to pass on. His prepared
                obituary did not provide much information. Sam had a family we
                could rely on this time. It has been a long time since Iâ€™ve been
                in the family position attending one of these, fortunately.
              </p>
              <p>
                We arrived early and got held up at the entrance. This wasnâ€™t
                uncommon. My wifeâ€™s first name is always miswritten and it
                wouldnâ€™t be the last time we would be held up while security
                examined our summons. We made it to Sam; the crowd was only
                starting to form so we took our positions. However common, the
                act of watching others pass on never sat well with my wife so we
                usually took the nosebleed section when available.
              </p>
              <p>
                Sam had opted for the somber scene, which I may choose for
                myself. There was a bed set in the center as always, but Sam had
                his family sitting there and he in a plush green chair. Sam had
                a lot on his mind. Certainly with life on the line, the anxiety
                of passing on isnâ€™t overlooked by anyone. Sam must have lived a
                minimal life; I did not notice any art or possessions he wanted
                to see one last time. I had never known Sam, but in these little
                choices for his final day, I felt a connection.
              </p>
              <p>
                Attendees filled in and the time drew closer. It has always
                struck me as a bit odd, attending these larger deathbeds, that I
                rarely recognize anyone in the crowd. Growing up in a smaller
                town, you couldnâ€™t help but see a majority of the same people.
                There was a warmth, usually reserved for the passing, that was
                shared by everyone because we all did know each other. These
                larger gatherings seem cold in comparison. Sam was born in this
                city though so thereâ€™s got to be some nuance in his decision.
              </p>
              <p>
                Light discussion between Sam and his family continued for some
                time. I could not make out any last wishes or advice. Final
                advice was probably the most compelling piece of the ceremony
                for me. Honestly, how many words in life can carry as much
                weight as someone's last? No matter what they chose to say,
                since they chose to say it, it's golden. Sam must have ended on
                a sweet note because the first few rows whispered bright sighs
                and even some audible awe.
              </p>
              <p>
                At last Sam grew quiet. He managed to throw up a slight thumbs
                up signaling the light operator. The white light was perhaps a
                bit too bright; my wife flinched at the most likely brand new
                bulb's glow. The crowd began the song, quickly gaining a harmony
                amongst ourselves.
              </p>
              <p>
                &quot;Sam, we will carry on the world you have built with us. In
                a single person's passing, all of our lives flash before our
                eyes but let us live on beyond this flash without you. We love
                you, Sam. Please will us to continue on!&quot;
              </p>
              <p>
                These words have become so monotonous, but for some reason they
                felt as if they had really came from my heart. Maybe because of
                my feelings for Sam, maybe for the feeling of my wife clinging
                to my arm after all these years, maybe because frankly the story
                shouldn't ever end. It was all up to Sam.
              </p>
              <p>
                Silence took over the crowd until the light dimmed. Sam's
                daughter had calmly walked over to him. She checked his pulse
                and gestured to the light operator. The light turned off and the
                crowd began to disperse. My wife and I were opposite the main
                exit so we headed towards a nearby stairwell. I caught a glance
                of Sam up close and was happy to see his slight grin.
