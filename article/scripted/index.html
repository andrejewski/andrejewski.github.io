                That first presidential debate I can never forget, the sound of
                the audience mumbling to themselves as she walked out on stage.
                When I stepped back from the podium to let her take my place, no
                one knew what was going on. After months of practice just for
                this event, this was Celestia's time to shine.
              </p>
              <p>
                Today Celestia's presence in our lives and her condition is so
                ubiquitous that we can often forget how difficult that night was
                to pull off. Just getting to the podium took days of planning.
                The layouts for these debate stages are always different and no
                one else would have needed so much notice to simply appear. I
                had to have come off so anal to be so exacting about the
                placement and ordering of podiums, but I had no choice. For
                Celestia's debut, everything needed to be perfect for the world
                to take a chance to truly embrace her as she was.
              </p>
              <p>
                Up until this point, as far as the world was concerned, it was
                me running for president. To the best of our abilities, Celestia
                was on no one's radar. People always ask me if I ever feel
                guilty for those years prior to that night. It's easy to look
                back now and say I was doing what I felt was right. As Celestia
                paced towards the podium and the crowd took notice of this young
                girl, my heart swelled. Deep inside, my anxiety was having a
                field day as her eyes met the crowd. I just had to have faith in
                Celestia that deceiving the country was a necessary step.
              </p>
              <p>
                Celestia stood at the podium for thirty seconds in silence. We
                had timed this to allow the crowd to take proper notice and let
                the cameras find their ways into position on her. As with every
                one of Celestia's appearances, timing is everything. Even today,
                with everyone in the loop, there's always that element of
                uncertainty that keeps me on my toes. That night, all we could
                do was have hope that the audience, the other candidates, or the
                moderator didn't throw us a curveball back.
              </p>
              <p>
                &quot;Hello. My name is Celestia Haler and I am running for
                President of the United States of America.&quot; The crowd went
                silent almost immediately.
              </p>
              <p>
                &quot;Serena Drac, standing to my right here, has been acting as
                my surrogate for the past seven years.&quot; She turned her head
                towards me, feigning to lock eyes and grin to put the ground at
                ease. I smiled back. &quot;However as we enter this next
                chapter, we need to clear the air. You need to know who I
                am.&quot;
              </p>
              <p>
                She paused again. This was supposed to be do-or-die time. If
                someone attempted to intervene or ask a question, this was the
                gap in her speech where I had to get us back on track. Luckily,
                everyone was quiet. As the seconds ticked down, I could not calm
                down. Finally in the last second, there was nothing else I could
                do. Celestia continued.
              </p>
              <p>
                &quot;I cannot see you. I cannot hear you. I do not taste the
                air I'm breathing, smell my surroundings, or even feel the
                weight of the clothes on my shoulders. Everything I am doing
                here tonight is scripted.&quot; There was no pause here.
                Celestia counted on these words leaving the crowd hushed if she
                made it this far.
              </p>
              <p>
                &quot;I lack the ability to respond to my senses. I do perceive
                everything a normal person would. The faces my eyes drift across
                now I will come to see eventually. Only when I rest does my mind
                gain access to these memories. Since I last woke, I have learned
                and absorbed nothing that my own mind did not conjure. I can
                only hope this explanation of my condition is well received in
                this present moment.&quot;
              </p>
              <p>
                The crowd began to become agitated with disbelief we were
                counting on. The initial phase of her speech was a success:
                whether or not they believed, they had at least understood
                enough to doubt Celestia's story.
              </p>
              <p>
                It wasn't time to prove it to them just yet. We wanted to
                leverage that disbelief to focus their attention so that
                Celestia could make her case for the presidency.

                &quot;It is abundantly clear in the polls that Serena Drac is
                the frontrunner in this election. Despite only serving one term
                in the Senate, she had done so much to improve our government
                and help our people. Every bill put in motion, policy decision,
                or otherwise that Serena carried was dictated by me.&quot;
              </p>
              <p>
                I stepped forward and affirmed her claim. I was anticipating at
                least one snide remark from one of the other candidates. Instead
                they were in awe, believing they were witnessing me tank my own
                political career. Admitting everything I had done was the
                machination of this little girl was a revolutionary form of
                political suicide. I haven't held any office since so it
                technically did mean the end for me I suppose.

                &quot;Every four years, candidates bring demands for a rebirth
                of America and new change. Months of bickering ensue, someone is
                elected, and anything but what they promised unfolds. I don't
                offer for your consideration promises, only results. Everything
                Serena and I have accomplished has rested on getting into the
                mud, talking to people shouldn't be talked to, finding
                non-obvious compromises that net, not only those with power but
                the average citizen, improvements to the status quo.&quot;
              </p>
              <p>
                &quot;The power of the presidency will allow me to take us even
                further than what can be accomplished now.&quot;
              </p>
              <p>
                Mostly negative reactions from the crowd as she took a pause.
                She delivered her speech perfectly and simulated engagement with
                the crowd with feigned eye contact and hand gestures. I could
                sense the core message had gotten across though. There were
                pockets of supportive, or perhaps gleefully anarchist, people in
                the crowd. After all the weeks of anxiety leading up to today, I
                felt so odd to feel great about such a reaction to the speech. I
                had to keep reminding myself this was going according to
                Celestia's plan.
              </p>
              <p>
                &quot;I am unable to participate in this debate as I cannot
                answer questions from the moderator or respond to other
                candidates. In my stead, Senator Drac will participate as
                originally planned.&quot;
              </p>
              <p>
                She took two steps back, the signal for me to move to the
                podium. She then shifted into place where I had been standing.
                There was nothing more she would do until the debate wrapped.
                She put on a small smile and then went about slowly scanning our
                surroundings.
              </p>
              <p>
                I looked out over the podium to a sea of bewilderment and
                disgust at me. Little did they know, everything that came next
                was the easy part.
              </p>
              <p>
                The moderator finally found words, &quot;Well, it looks like
                we're going to have to adjust some of tonight's questions.&quot;
                A few chuckles from the crowd, and they cut to a commercial
                break.
              </p>
              <p>
                I took a few steps back from the podium, a signal I was ready
                for an ear full. The other candidates walked over to take the
                job. Governor Dennis Florence didn't know what to say,
                &quot;Thank you? It isn't too often someone throws the
                presidency into my lap.&quot;
              </p>
              <p>
                &quot;He's right, Serena. I know this is the first joke you've
                ever attempted but the delivery was too much. You just scared
                everyone off and threw this race to Dennis.&quot; Gregory Hill
                had every intention of using his position to lend his support to
                me in the final stretch of the election. He handled the betrayal
                better than I anticipated he would.
              </p>
              <p>
                &quot;You aren't wrong, it is over for me. I knew that from the
                beginning.&quot;
              </p>
              <p>
                &quot;And for what? This stunt? So this girl can get fifteen
                minutes of fame and then be laughed at the rest of her
                life?&quot; Gregory let me have it. &quot;You better get your
                act together and put the kibosh on this while you still
                can.&quot;
              </p>
              <p>
                &quot;You scare me, Serena. This is so...I know your will
                wouldn't snap just like this. You really think you know what
                you're doing. Absolutely terrifying.&quot; Dennis took a few
                steps toward Celestia. &quot;Is this girl really the ace up your
                sleeve?&quot;
              </p>
              <p>
                &quot;Don't touch her,&quot; I pressed as I put myself between
                them. Celestia had not changed her position. She was still
                scanning the audience and catching glimpses of the podiums,
                silent and stiff as always.
              </p>
              <p>
                The stage crew gave a signal to get back to our stations.
                Gregory and Dennis started walking back. &quot;You know, as much
                as I appreciate this, I can't help but want to root for you and
                you're insanity. At least don't get boring on us now.&quot;
                Dennis smiled and for the first time I actually found some
                respect for him.
              </p>
              <p>
                &quot;Heck of a way to end your career,&quot; Gregory muttered.
              </p>
              <p>
                The intermission helped the audience draw two possible
                conclusions. Celestia was either a well trained child actor or
                her story was legitimate. She had been standing as she was,
                moving so monotonically for so long it had to be scripted in
                some way. The hostility had been abated, confusion and curiosity
                now hung heavy in the air.
              </p>
              <p>
                &quot;Senator Drac, would you like to clarify anything from
                before the break for the American people?&quot; The moderator
                threw out the lifeline but even if I wasn't serious it was too
                late now to change course. Oddly, it was finally like I was in
                my element.
              </p>
              <p>
                &quot;I can answer any questions you have, but I stand behind
                everything that's been shared tonight.&quot;
              </p>
              <p>
                &quot;So you are saying you are no longer a candidate in this
                race? The candidate you are putting forth is this girl standing
                beside you?&quot;
              </p>
              <p>
                &quot;Celestia. Yes, she is the person really running for
                president.&quot;
              </p>
              <p>
                &quot;Why should your supporters give their support to
                Celestia?&quot;
              </p>
              <p>
                &quot;All the progress we've made is thanks to Celestia. She
                felt it was necessary to work behind myself until she was ready
                to face the world. From the beginning we wanted to be
                transparent with the American people, but we had to be practical
                given her condition. Now our cards are fully on the table. We
                would appreciate your continued support.&quot;
              </p>
              <p>
                Dennis finally cut in, &quot;Serena, is this girl even old
                enough to be president?&quot;
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Celestia is nineteen.&quot;</p>
              <p>
                &quot;Nineteen? She doesn't look older than ten.&quot; Gregory
                was right about that. Celestia had not come of age as a normal
                child would.
              </p>
              <p>
                The moderator took back control. &quot;Frankly, this is quite
                the curveball. We did have an agenda of questions I thought the
                American people would want to hear answered, but Senator I think
                this is all too much to ignore. How would you all like to
                proceed?&quot;
              </p>
              <p>
                &quot;I'd love to understand the implosion we're witnessing
                personally,&quot; Gregory jeered. &quot;However I'd hate to lend
                credence to Serena's story, waste everyone's time dissecting a
                joke gone wrong, and miss the chance to discuss real
                issues.&quot; Roars from the crowd supported his stance.
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Those are my sentiments as well.&quot;</p>
              <p>
                &quot;How about it, Senator? Can you prove you're not wasting
                the American people's time with a farce?&quot;
              </p>
              <p>
                &quot;We accept the proposal to be put on the hot seat. I
                promise it'll be a much better use of time than what was
                planned.&quot;
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Well, how would you like to start?&quot;</p>
              <p>
                &quot;The timing is a bit off so give her a moment.&quot; I took
                a few steps back from the podium. A moment passed and then
                Celestia walked back to the podium to resume her speech. I
                stepped aside to where she had been standing. It was her show
                now.
