                You've heard of Christianity. You've probably heard a story or
                ten from the Bible and perhaps even participated in Christmas
                festivities. Is Christianity cool? Well, you're probably not
                quite sure. Especially due to its rocky, crusader-y past and
                Catholic recent past. We've also got a bunch of frankly weird
                people that assert themselves on others claiming it's for God's
                sake but really for their own.
              </p>
              <p>
                I would like to share and convey a deeper interpretation of
                Christianity, what makes it cool and special to me, in this
                article. I ask you as a reader to put a lot of the externalities
                aside, and take a walk with me through the garden. Let's talk
                about Christianity.
              </p>
              <h2 id="structure"><a href="#structure">Structure</a></h2>
              <p>
                We're gonna be talking about the bible. There's a ton of content
                in the bible. I myself haven't read all of it. Let's do a quick
                recap of its structure. The bible is divided into two parts, the
                Old Testament (starting with the Torah, or Jewish bible) and the
                New Testament (Jesus and aftermath). The Old Testament is
                generally longer, ranging depending on religion to 24 to over 46
                books. The New Testament is 27 books.
              </p>
              <p>
                The most important book of the Old Testament in my opinion is
                Genesis. For the New Testament, the first four books: Matthew,
                Mark, Luke, and John are most important. These four books tell
                the story of Jesus Christ from the perspective of each
                respective disciple.

              <p>
                I'm not a bible expert so I'm wrong, of this I am sure. But hey,
                let's not ruin a good walk. Here we go, a summary of the major
                parts of the bible.
              </p>
              <p>
                Step one: (Genesis) God creates everything but humans, and then
                he creates humans. God makes humans in his image and asks them
                to maintain the Garden of Eden. Things go downhill from here and
                in exchange humans get free will. God doesn't like what he sees
                and corrects quite a bit (hitting the reset button with Noah and
                the ark for example).
              </p>
              <p>
                Eventually God chooses a chosen group of people, the Jews. The
                Jews make a contract with God and they adopt rules and
                sacrifices, and suffer a lot in Egypt and basically anywhere
                they go. If we tried to summarize their goal, it was to build
                the kingdom of God on Earth. Something approximating a utopia.
                They tried this many times and failed states always resulted.
              </p>
              <p>
                Eventually the son of God, Jesus Christ makes his appearance. He
                flexes his powers through a series of miracles, assembles a
                group of disciples, and gives sermons. He is crucified,
                portraying an archetypical worst death ever and in that
                sacrifice frees all others from sin. He resurrects days later
                and enters Heaven.
              </p>
              <p>
                The disciples catalog and disseminate Jesus's teachings. The
                Jewish people continue to wait for their savior, or messiah, to
                arrive. Christians await the end of days, at least according to
                the last book of the bible Revelations. That book is a bit of a
                fever dream that makes you think &quot;wow, not many people have
                read the bible.&quot;

              </h2>
              <p>
                Allow me to go even further and simplify the bible by the broad
                strokes:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Humans are created and dang are they fascinating:
                  <ul>
                    <li>Made in God's image,</li>
                    <li>Capable of defying God,</li>
                    <li>Capable of speaking to God,</li>
                    <li>Capable of angering God.</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                  God's really got a can of worms here and experiments a bunch,
                  throwing things at the wall and seeing what sticks. It's a
                  creative process.
                </li>
                <li>
                  God: Okay, this is kind of a mess. God tries to work with just
                  a single group of people and make them successful.
                </li>
                <li>
                  God: Okay, this is kind of not going anywhere. God's next
                  strategy: I'm just gonna go down there myself and set a
                  perfect example for these humans (Jesus).
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      If you'd like to, imagine this as an analogue to the end
                      credit scene of the Avenger's movie where Thanos says
                      &quot;Fine, I'll do it myself.&quot;
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>God: Did it work? I'm kinda out of ideas.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                In an even more condensed summary, the Old Testament is an
                experiment in achieving Heaven on Earth through the
                <strong>group</strong> or state. Changing it up, The New
                Testament is an experiment in achieving Heaven on Earth through
                the <strong>individual</strong>.
              </p>
              <p>
                I'm personally open to believing there's more room for
                experimentation, but Christianity stops at the conclusion that
                the world can only be made a utopia through the sacrifice of the
                individual who lives their best life in service of others.

              </h2>
              <p>
                Atheists who talk to me about the bible always bring up
                suffering. It's a hot topic for sure. If God is omnipotent and
                can pick and choose anything that happens in the universe why
                have suffering?
              </p>
              <p>
                I think the first place to start with omnipotence is the
                contradictions that entails. The two main examples:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Can you have more than one omnipotent being? One may say no,
                  because to be omnipotent one must have all the power; it
                  doesn't work to have someone else capable of undoing all your
                  work. Having all the power could imply no one else has any.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Can an omnipotent being create something they then cannot
                  control? If they can do anything, then yes they could. But if
                  they could not control it anymore, it seems that would make
                  them not omnipotent <em>anymore</em>.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                In this sense, the bible is a story of delegation of power. God
                created humans to manage the world he creates and in doing so
                makes a 50+ book treatise on the subject.
              </p>
              <p>
                As for suffering, we know in the Garden of Eden there was none;
                so God was capable of achieving it initially. However, in
                delegating and creating God-like creatures with free will,
                suffering became a possibility.
              </p>
              <p>
                Now you've maybe heard all this before, the coupling of
                suffering and free will and the like is a common point of
                debate. That's not the coolest part of the bible but it is the
                foundation for what makes Christianity so cool.
              </p>
              <p>
                Let's examine the coolest quote in the entire bible, so cool
                both Matthew and Mark wrote it down:
              </p>
              <blockquote>
                <p>
                  And about the ninth hour Jesus cried out with a loud voice,
                  saying, “Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani?” that is to say, “My God,
                  My God, why hast Thou forsaken Me?” – Matthew 27:46
                </p>
              </blockquote>
              <blockquote>
                <p>
                  And at three in the afternoon Jesus cried out in a loud voice,
                  <em>“Eloi, Eloi, lema sabachthani?”</em> (which means “My God,
                  my God, why have you forsaken me?”). – Mark 15:34
                </p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>
                There's room for interpretation to make this quote seem not as
                cool as I think it is, but roll with me on this. This is as
                Jesus, the son of God and God on Earth, is being crucified. The
                crucifixion and the events leading up to it are, if taken as
                metaphor, an archetype of maximum suffering, and this quote
                arrives at the climax of that suffering.
              </p>
              <p>
                For the atheists reading this article, surprise! In my
                interpretation of this quote, for a brief moment Jesus was one
                of you. He was under so much suffering that he questioned God
                and asks why he had been put through this suffering.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong
                  >God, placed in human form, could deny that God
                  exists.</strong
                >
              </p>
              <p>
                This is an absolutely crazy concept. The burden of the nature of
                humanity and the human form is one which even the most supreme
                being cannot overcome. God may have created humans, but in this
                brief moment we learn that the patients would overtake the
                asylum. The human form is so weak, and yet so strong, that it
                can subdue even its creator.
              </p>

                  >What I take away from Christianity</a
                >
              </h2>
              <p>
                Christianity teaches us humility and understanding of our
                neighbors and ourselves. If God cannot act perfectly in human
                form, what chance do we have? But at the same time, being human
                can level the playing field. Through hard work, caring about
                each other, and trying to be our best in our daily lives, we may
                not build back the utopia God once had.
              </p>
              <p>
                What we can build in our juxtaposed condition, as fallible
                beings with free will, even God could not have imagined. The
                outcome could be absolutely terrifying, or we could challenge
                ourselves to complete God's mission and perhaps surpass it.
              </p>
              <p>
                The bible can be taken as a set of God's teachings on how to
                live and work towards Heaven, but we cannot embrace them
                absolutely because even God in our form could not. There is no
                perfect solution we are capable of implementing, but we must
                try–with an understanding for ourselves and others that even God
                could not do it <em>alone, anymore</em>.
