                My whole life I thought I had poopy blood. The type of blood
                that no one else would be eligible for if I did donate. In 2024,
                I revisited this thinking and donated blood.
              </p>
              <p>
                If you've never donated blood before or you have and haven't
                made it a habit, this is a life experience piece about my
                donating blood the maximum amount this year. Maybe reading about
                my experience will encourage you to give it a try too.

              </h1>
              <p>
                I didn't know my blood type. I had a hunch from a hospital stay
                many, many years ago that it was something like AB. However, I
                didn't really know. Not at all well enough to accept blood if I
                needed it. So I went to donate blood: they would tell me what my
                blood type is.
              </p>
              <p>
                My first donation was pretty stressful. I'd never given blood
                before and have many friends who are afraid of blood and
                needles. I had been cocooned in this echo fear chamber for a lot
                of my life and went into donating fairly blind.
              </p>
              <p>
                In Seattle, my nearest blood donation center is Bloodworks
                Northwest and so I scheduled an appointment online with them and
                turned up to donate. My first reaction: there are a lot of
                upfront checks and stuff prior to the actual giving blood part.
              </p>
              <p>
                Before you even get checked in at the waiting area, you've
                already read a couple PDFs of possible disqualifications and
                completed a questionnaire, which must be completed that day.
                Then they take your pulse, your weight, squeeze your arm with
                that thingâ€“you know the one, and lastly do a hemoglobin test to
                make sure you have enough iron. Then we get down to business.
              </p>
              <p>
                Afterwards, about two days later, I got a notification about my
                blood type. What the blood test showed was practically the exact
                opposite of what I thought. I didn't have garbage blood, I had
                the second best blood type for donations: O+. (70% of people can
                accept O+ and it is often used in emergencies/ICUs.)
              </p>
              <p>
                Knowing that I had blood someone would want encouraged me to
                continue donating blood.

              <p>
                The maximum someone can donate blood is six times a year. I went
                all six times. So I feel pretty good to give a review of the
                experience.
              </p>
              <p>
                For the fearful, of the six donation experiences, I would say
                two were not great. I wish it was all sun and rainbows but even
                going to the same donation center each time, I had nurses of
                different experience levels, with different approaches, and with
                different levels of luck.
              </p>
              <p>
                Bad experience 1: Bruh, the needle straight up hurt. One nurse
                stuck it in, but not enough. Another nurse came over and
                adjusted it into a better position. The initial stick hurt more
                than all the other sticks I'd had in total, easily. At the time,
                I thought the nurse just wasn't very gentle, but it's hard to
                say that gentleness is even the right quality you want. The
                adjusting also hurt, so definitely a painful experience.
              </p>
              <p>
                Bad experience 2: The needle was stuck, but not at a good angle
                to have the blood flow. I know at least two people who are gonna
                be grossed to death hearing this but instead of re-sticking or
                adjusting the nurse took a different approach. They tilted the
                needle in my arm just enough to get the blood flowing right.
              </p>
              <p>
                This experience wasn't super painfulâ€“nothing like bad experience
                1. What made it a bad experience was how unplanned or rare it
                seemed, especially after I had gone a few times. In prior
                visits, the nurse would stick you and then walk off and leave
                you to calmly drain.
              </p>
              <p>
                Here the nurse stuck by my side, holding the needle in place,
                for the entire duration (about 5-6 minutes). I was scared and
                stressed for all that time, wondering if everything was gonna be
                okay. The nurse didn't exude confidence as it was all happening.
                However, I do understand not wanting to stress someone out more
                by explaining verbally what you're doing to them. I did not
                state my preference of knowing what was going on, I was too
                scared; so it's hard to fault the nurse. But yeah, stressful.
              </p>
              <p>
                All the other times were just fine. The needle stick isn't too
                bad and I still do always look away when it is being placed.
              </p>
              <p>
                Pain-wise, I've actually found the pre-screening hemoglobin test
                to be more painful than the donation itself. (They prick your
                finger for a little drop of blood to test. Your finger is a bit
                more sensitive than your elbow pit.)
              </p>
              <p>
                My stress has gone over my visits, and attribute some of that to
                the controlled setting. Some nurses even remember me at this
                point. So I definitely recommend scheduling a visit to a
                donation center if you want to make a routine of donating.
              </p>
              <p>Overall, I'm happy with the experience.</p>
              <h1 id="post-donation">

              </h1>
              <p>
                After giving blood, I've personally had it pretty chill. No side
                effects to speak of really. I do avoid exercise for the rest of
                the day as they recommend.
              </p>
              <p>
                There was only one time, post-donation, that freaked me out a
                bit. I mention it because I was scared and so talking about it
                may calm others down.
              </p>
              <p>
                The nurses wrap your arm in a wrap (gauss) after the needle is
                removed so the puncture wound can heal up. They want you
                removing the wrap anytime after four hours.
              </p>
              <p>
                When I donate, afterwards I go back to work. Only when I get
                home do I remove the wrap while I take a shower. Once I had kept
                a wrap on for about 9 hours. It was wrapped a bit tighter than
                usual too. I took it off perhaps a bit too quickly and re-opened
                the puncture wound, enough it was bleeding a bit.
              </p>
              <p>
                This spooked me. I covered it with a cotton ball and waited
                maybe ten minutes. The blood stopped. It was all good.
              </p>
              <h1 id="blood-facts"><a href="#blood-facts">Blood facts</a></h1>
              <p>Here's some cool things I've learned:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    O+ and O- blood sometimes has a special quota for those
                    emergency situations I mentioned. I was thrilled to know my
                    blood would be flying around in emergency helicopters. This
                    takes some chances though, sometimes there's no quota to
                    fill so your donation is &quot;just&quot; a regular one.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    It takes about three donations to complete an average blood
                    transfusion. So in a year, you can provide two blood
                    transfusions.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    Bloodworks and other donation centers keep a running tally
                    of the amount of blood you donated. It's about a pint
                    (500ml) each time. It's cool watching the &quot;score&quot;
                    go up over time.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    There are other donations you can do: platelets, plasma, and
                    if O+ or O- &quot;double red cell&quot; which is like two
                    whole blood donations in one except they give you your
                    plasma back. I've not tried other donation types, but the
                    double red cell sounds interesting and perhaps convenient
                    because you only need to donate three times a year to max
                    out.
                  </p>
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                So yeah, that's the blood donation experience. I hope you found
                this useful and encouraging. If you're in the Seattle area and
                want a donation buddy, I'm happy to support you in getting
                started with donating. It definitely can help having someone
                there the first few times.
              </p>
              <p>Happy donating!</p>
