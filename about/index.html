I live in my hometown of Erie, Pennsylvania.
I am a software engineer and computer scientist.
I have been programming almost ten years.
I contribute to and maintain a lot of open source projects.
</p><p>My career goal is to be able to carry a software product
  from start to finish.
This means I want to know how to do everything from idea
  to execution to scaling to maintenance.
I know quite a bit of this by now but I am still learning.
My current points of interest are distributed systems
  and high-level, service-oriented architectures.
</p><p>Outside of software, I do a few other things.
My favorite hobby is watching films, I have seen hundreds
  and am always open to recommendations.
I also watch television, especially comedies and stand up
  specials but also a drama here and there.
I have a fat dog named Comet who steals my socks every
  morning and burps in my face now and then.
I play soccer and tennis when the weather is good, and
  enjoy bowling, air hockey, and skee ball any time.
I celebrate with steak and enjoy country drives.
</p><p>I enjoy talking to people so if you want to talk about
  a project or idea or befriend me, please <a href="mailto:christopher.andrejewski@gmail.com">contact me</a>.

The summer of 2016 I visited the Smokey Mountains at
  the North Carolina-Kentucky border.
I love nature and this is what I leave my house to find.</p></div></div></div><script>(function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i['GoogleAnalyticsObject']=r;i[r]=i[r]||function(){(i[r].q=i[r].q||[]).push(arguments)},i[r].l=1*new Date();a=s.createElement(o),m=s.getElementsByTagName(o)[0];a.async=1;a.src=g;m.parentNode.insertBefore(a,m)})(window,document,'script','//www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js','ga');ga('create', 'UA-43674193-3', 'auto');ga('send', 'pageview');</script></body></html>
