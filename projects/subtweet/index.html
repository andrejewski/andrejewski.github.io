to combat the issues of their own Direct Messaging (DM) service.
And here is the story of everything that happened.
</p><p>To many of us in the developer community
who use Twitter, it was unfathomable how Twitter had so
greatly neglected their Direct Messaging service. There were
a lot of problems with it and the roadmap for improvements
was non-existent. This left open room for innovation
for however temporary the window was open.
</p><p>Subtweet was that innovation. Subtweet mimicked the general
concepts of Twitter DMs and on top of it built group
messaging, tweet embedding, public conversations, made
conversation real-time (instead of using slow polling),
never deleted old messages over time, and removed the
character limit on messages. It used Twitter’s API for
most everything and I did not see it as being anything
but better Direct Messaging. As I used Subtweet
alongside Twitter for conversations, Subtweet
out performed in all aspects of messaging.
</p><figure class="asset"><img width="469" src="/images/subtweet/homepage.jpg"><figcaption>The Subtweet homepage features the key benefits it has
over Twitter's service and a single call-to-action
front and center.
</figcaption></figure><p>To build such an app, I used some new tools:
React, Flux, and Superagent (bundled with Browserify).
I did originally try to do server-side rendering but
as the main app view got more complex I knew I would
need to bring more functionality into the client for
speed and smoothness. Out of my experience with React
and Flux, I built my own Flux-architecture
<a href="https://github.com/andrejewski/emf">Even More Flux</a> 
that I prefer in newer applications where React is needed
instead of the bare architecture provided by Facebook.
</p><figure class="asset"><img width="469" src="/images/subtweet/create.jpg"><figcaption>The desktop application is designed as a spilt layout:
the first view contains all conversations and displays
notifcations, new messages, and account settings access.
</figcaption></figure><figure class="asset"><img width="457" src="/images/subtweet/conversation.jpg"><figcaption>The second view contains the current conversation, the box
to send a new message, and the detail view about who is in
the conversation and requests to join the group.
</figcaption></figure></div><div class="document document-left"><p>Well-versed in the Twitter API, I was able to divert 
most of the work of authenticating users and loading
embedded tweets to Twitter. Subtweet
required a database only for user sessions and message
storage, every other piece of information was imported
from Twitter. Operation costs were low on my end
and there was no need to keep local data fresh as
I could tap 
Twitter to update user information behind the scenes.
</p><p>This ease is, however, not Twitter’s intention. 
In order to offload the work to Twitter, I had to do
a lot of hacking on their JavaScript library to get
it to work as I wanted it. Working around the
Twitter API was where most of my development
time was spent. Luckily some brave souls had come 
before me and made open-source projects to expedite the 
authentication process, but for anything else I was
on my own.
</p><figure class="asset"><img width="200" src="/images/subtweet/conversation-mobile.jpg"><img width="200" src="/images/subtweet/details-mobile.jpg"><figcaption>In the mobile application, the split view is collapsed
and the conversation view becomes prominent. The list
of conversations folds into a navigation bar.
</figcaption></figure><p>I designed Subtweet from the beginning to be a 
mobile-first application. This meant building all the 
functionality cleanly into the mobile experience
and then growing out the design for the desktop
experience. The intention was that people who most
likely be communicating with their phones instead
of going to their computer to check-in or respond.
Without building a native application for both iOS
and Android, a mobile-first webapp was the fastest
and most cost-effective solution.
</p><p>Twitter finally launched group messaging and now
it seems Subtweet no longer has a strong use case.
While Subtweet does have many features Twitter does not,
other means of communication are more suitable for the
use cases that remain. Subtweet shut down in the
subsequent months after exporting conversation histories
for interested users.</p></div></div></div><div class="projects section"><div class="major-projects"><div class="container"><h2>Apps</h2></div><a href="/projects/subtweet/" class="project"><div class="container"><div class="document document-left"><h3>Subtweet</h3><p>The solution to Twitter DMs, Subtweet extends Twitter's
