The ability 
to capture these ideas quickly and effectively is an 
important enterprise. Jamarkus was an application with aims 
of being that capture utility.
</p><p>At the time of Jamarkus's inception, applications that 
recorded personal thoughts were either crummy note-taking 
applications or a trusty hand-written journal or hand-typed 
text file. Jamarkus is different because it was accessible 
from anywhere, any computer or mobile device. As a web 
application there was no need to install tedious updates 
and thoughts reflected across multiple mediums 
synchronously.
</p><h2>Strategy</h2><p>Jamarkus is targeted at abstract-random and concrete random 
thinkers. A system for capturing those types of 
unstructured and obscure ideas should be catered to such 
needs.
</p><p>Whatever organization structure is implemented must also be 
light-weight and quickly fade away to allow someone to 
focus on their idea alone. Not unnecessary buttons are 
cruft should complicate the experience.
</p><p>Imagination is limitless and the recorder should follow 
suit. Notes should be able to express as many mediums of 
information as possible. There needs to be a flexible 
interface to allow text, quotes, pictures, links, and 
videos.

Ideas form instantly and they should be reflected across 
someone's devices at all times. No one is tied to her 
desktop, laptops and phones offer quicker access to any 
application especially while in roam. Having all of their 
thoughts with them at any time helps frame and build out 
new thoughts.
</p><h2>Design</h2><p>Every great web application needs equally great homepage. 
instead of images I opted for pure CSS to generate the 
imagery. Since CSS is pixel and vector based, on any device 
the icons will look crisp.

</figcaption></figure><p>The Jamarkus brand is a composition different shades of 
green and white which are present in all application 
screens. Once logged in to the application, the 
eye-catching green takes a backseat to the eye-soothing 
white.
</p><figure class="asset"><img width="439" src="/images/jamarkus/application.png" alt="Jamarkus Application"><figcaption>Jamarkus is a split view application. The notebooks are
always accessible from the left, and a given notebook's
notes appear on the right along with a box to add new notes.
</figcaption></figure><p>I choose to go with the most simple form of organization, 
the list. Jamarkus terms these collections of ideas books, 
which in turn contain notes. Books are completed optional; 
if under-used, all notes still appear in the "All Notes" 
collection.

Book creation and editing were made as easy to operate as 
possible. Jamarkus keeps the user's focus by maintaining 
almost the entire application in one screen.
</p><figure class="asset"><img width="150" alt="Book List" src="/images/jamarkus/book-normal.png"><img width="150" alt="Book Create" src="/images/jamarkus/book-create.png"><img width="150" alt="Book Edit" src="/images/jamarkus/book-edit.png"><figcaption>Creating a new notebook is as simple as typing a name and
hitting enter. Editing a notebook is just a double-click
on the notebook that should be edited or deleted.
</figcaption></figure><p>The implementation of notes was even more simple. All that 
was required for notes was really a text box. When punching 
out a quick note a submit button is not needed, instead 
listening for an Enter key made note entry much more 
efficient. Editing was just a simple except editing 
requires an explicit submit as notes can be stretched out 
into multiple paragraphs over time. The content of notes is 
Markdown.
</p><figure class="asset"><img width="255" alt="Note Edit" src="/images/jamarkus/note-edit.png"><figcaption>Notes support Markdown which allows users to use complex text
formatting and embed images and links.
</figcaption></figure><p>With hundreds of notes, some organized into books and some 
not, search was a necessary feature can Jamarkus took 
advantage of screen real estate by having the note entry 
bar toggle into a search bar with instant results as 
someone types a query. Again, no need for a submit button.
</p><figure class="asset"><img width="429" alt="Note Search" src="/images/jamarkus/search.png"><figcaption>Search gives instant feeback about what notes match the query.
With all of the notes loaded on the client, search was instantanious.
</figcaption></figure><p>And what of being available on all devices? In my 
consistent designing fashion, the application is completely 
responsive. Both desktop and mobile have the exact same 
features and speed.
</p><figure class="asset"><img width="200" alt="Books Mobile Screen" src="/images/jamarkus/books-mobile.png"><img width="200" alt="Notes Mobile Screen" src="/images/jamarkus/notes-mobile.png"><figcaption>The mobile application breaks the split view into the navigation
at the top and the notes of whichever notebook is selected in
the rest of the view.
</figcaption></figure><p>As someone who has used many different note taking 
application beforehand, I had come across pain points with 
vendor lock-in. Jamarkus did not own user data. A 
preference page was created so people could download their 
notes and even wipe their entire accounts from Jamarkus 
servers.
</p><figure class="asset"><img width="439" alt="Preferences Screen" src="/images/jamarkus/preferences.png"><figcaption>Jamarkus does not require much information about the user. 
It is a note taking service nothing more. So change your name
or your password and export your notes if you want.
</figcaption></figure><p>All in all, it was a pretty extensive single page 
application. The layout and interactions were not designed 
for everyone. Jamarkus is a very niche product that targets 
the transcendent minds, ones which would appreciate the 
minimalism and lack of distraction.
</p><h2>Development</h2><p>As a technology, Jamarkus is pretty sweet. The server-side 
is a Node.js Express app using Mongoose and MongoDB for 
persistence. But the application is extended to handle not 
only HTTP requests but also Websocket (Socket.io) 
connections. The client is pure JavaScript using Backbone 
as the data layer, React as the view, and a Socket.io 
connection for coordination with the server/controller.
</p><p>Notes are written in Markdown, which allows text formatting 
and tons of other extensibility. There are many 
interesting, intricate details that are quite original as 
well: auto-magic synchronization of the entire app, the 
immutability of the client-side data, and offline 
functionality to name a few.
</p><p>While building Jamarkus, I found myself struggling to 
incorporate Backbone with React. To relieve the pain, I 
invested in creating a common library which manages this 
integration. The library is called Reactbone and 
open-source on Github.
</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>Jamarkus is a personal project of mine that I released in 
an early alpha stage of the product. It attained some 300 
users before I made the decision to terminate the 
application.
</p><p>With so many note-taking competitors with large user bases, 
I still believed Jamarkus could find a niche market based 
on its unique features. In the months following however the 
landscape shifted and today many popular note applications 
cater to Jamarkus's core feature set.
</p><p>I decided to work on to something more challenging and less 
congested. Jamarkus seised operations in May 2014.</p></div></div></div><div class="projects section"><div class="major-projects"><div class="container"><h2>Apps</h2></div><a href="/projects/subtweet/" class="project"><div class="container"><div class="document document-left"><h3>Subtweet</h3><p>The solution to Twitter DMs, Subtweet extends Twitter's
