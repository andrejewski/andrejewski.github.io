National Honor Society</h1><p>My high school Northwest Pennsylvania Collegiate Academy (NPCA) has a National
Honor Society club. The members are junior and senior 
students and the senior class has elected officials that
manage the club. There are only four electoral positions
â€” president, vice president, secretary, and treasurer.
Needless to say, a club such as NHS requires a lot of
coordination. With more than 150 members, a lot of things
needed to be improved, steam-lined, automated, and
eliminated. That's where I came in.
</p><h2>Problems</h2><p>The problems faced by the NHS officials were plentiful.
News and announcements needed to be distributed via email,
which was often a hit-or-miss and many students would not
check their email account urgently enough to respond.
Volunteering opportunities were disorderly with emails
back and forth, handling which events were at capacity
and which needed to be filled. There was a clear disconnect
between the officials and the members.
</p><p>Email was as technologically advanced as the club had
progressed. To log service hours, members had to fill out
complicated forms for each event they attended and some
lost the hours they mistakenly forgot to record. This
particular club required a certain number of service hours
for any given member to remain in good standing.
</p><p>Managing the announcements, the events, who was going, who
did go, how many hours members had volunteered were very
overwhelming problems. if I were to improve the NHS
experience I needed to address all of these pain points.
</p><h2>Strategy</h2><p>I began researching National Honor Society structure,
organizations, and the tasks that revolved around a
successful club.
</p><p>The most apparent concept of NHS was the member hierarchy.
The highest authority is the administrator, which is usually
a teacher or member of the school's staff. Then there are the
senior officers, followed by the committee heads, and finally
all other members.
</p><p>In order to represent this structure digitally, each member
is given a role which allows or disallows permissions to
components of the application, such as adding new members.
Administrators can do everything, officers less so, and so
on down the pyramid.
</p><p>It was important to keep in mind the user base is primarily
teenagers, messy, destructive, and potentially-corruptible
teenagers. The security and permissions for any management
system need to robust, but more so with a younger audience
that might seek out exploitations.
</p><p>The next step was member registration. In years past, this
was simply collecting a name and email address. I had no
desire to complicate this process. Unlike most registration
however, no one could just "sign up." A registration system
needed to be implemented.
</p><p>Announcements and news only need to have a title, subtitle,
and text. Administrators also should be allowed to draft
announcements so they can preview and collaborate on them
before they are published. Markdown would offer a great amount
of flexibility to article text with the added benefit of
plaintext just working without any formatting knowledge.
</p><p>Volunteering events are a bit more tricky. Looking at the
array of events the NHS club hosted or broadcast, I noticed
a pattern of how often one event would have multiple times.
Events needed to be structured to cater to multiple times
whilst easily sharing a unified description.
</p><p>Events are also interactive. Members attend events.
There would need to be a way for a member to schedule
their participation in an event. This would allow officers
to see who is attending and better monitor attendance and
service hours.
</p><p>With a checklist of features and understanding of the NHS
process, I moved on to the pretty part.
</p><h2>Design</h2><p>The easiest part of the NHS system to design was the homepage.
This page did not require much functionality. Any type of
visitor, member or not, would most likely view this page.
It just needed to welcome, assist navigation, and above all
else look professional.
</p><figure class="asset"><img alt="Homepage" src="/images/npca-nhs/homepage.png"><figcaption>The homepage includes the navigation, the names of the current
board members, and a cover background of the school's entrance.
</figcaption></figure><p>The actual application is much more minimal. To provide a
greater focus on content such as announcements and event,
and also to reduce visual clutter, it was important to keep
screens direct and simple.
</p><figure class="asset"><img alt="Announcements and News" src="/images/npca-nhs/news-feed.png"><figcaption>A major component of the NHS system is announcements. A news
feed, blog-like posting system is the ideal solution. This
solution includes drafting, Markdown-based editing, and open
collaboration between officers.
</figcaption></figure><p>The colors used are based upon Collegiate's school colors
of gold and blue. To increase the visibility and recognition
of certain elements, I included one of many Octicons to the mix.
</p><p>Each screen only provides primary information about one object
at a time; there is no competition for engagement, which 
improves usability while reducing complexity.
</p><figure class="asset"><img alt="Event Page" src="/images/npca-nhs/event.png"><figcaption>Events and announcements share many attributes, but what makes
events unique is the ability to add multiple times for each
event as research showed events were rarely one-time only and
listing all event times is most conveinent.
</figcaption></figure><p>Individual events have there own pages contain a description
of the event and multiple event times. The button group below
the description is only visible and usable by officers or
administrators.
</p><p>Event is one central event which contains multiple different
event times. For example, the clubs likes having bi-weekly
meetings with one meeting before and another meeting after
school. Event times save the trouble of duplicating
information and the muddling of information hierarchy.
</p><figure class="asset"><img alt="User Profile" src="/images/npca-nhs/user-profile.png"><figcaption>The member profile shows the total number of service hours,
whether or not the member is in bad standing (only officers
and the user can see this), and a personal timeline of 
volunteering and event attendance.
</figcaption></figure><p>The user profile screen is my favorite because it really
speaks to the power technology can bring to organization
and management. The profile display the user's name, title
(I made mine the CTO), an editable biography. There record
of all my combined services hours, what events I have
attended, and what events I have scheduled to attend.
</p><p>Why this is my favorite requires some context. To manually
construct this service record previously, a member would have
had to fill out at least five forms correctly and promptly
and an officer would need to tabulate and verify these forms
to sum up the hours. Multiply that by 200 and hair pulling
results. The man-hours wasted is a tragedy.
</p><p>The NHS application handles all of these things, there no more
forms to fill out and no one needs a calculator on standby.
This user profile renders in a fraction of a second and
updates just as fast. That is simply powerful.
</p><p>There's one last thing. It is important to remember the user
base is comprised of teenagers. Teenagers are on their mobile
devices more than any other age group. To not have a mobile
version of the NHS application would be unjustifiable.

All of 
the desktop views are designed to work on mobile screens as
well. The same functionality exists on both sizes.
</figcaption></figure></div><div class="document document-left"><p>Yes, the application is desktop, tablet, and mobile friendly
with zero complicated redirects or other distractions.
</p><h2>Development</h2><p>I divided the whole project into two parts. The website was
hand-coded with Jade, the resultant HTML, and CSS. This work
is really just the homepage and the mission statement page
as some much of the project is the real application.
</p><p>The application is written in Node.js using Express 4 to
provide the excellently performant and modular routing logic.
All communication with the database is handled by the Mongoose
ORM. The database is MongoDB and configuration and setting
files are JSON that I exposed asynchronously so they could
change without breaking the running application.
</p><p>The components of the application are separated into distinct
folders contain each objects routes, model, and helpers.
Marked handles converting text to HTML. Passport handles
the authentication of members. Nodemailer handles registration
and password resets for members. All of these dependencies
are managed with the always reliable NPM.
</p><p>The website and application happily coexist proxied behind
Nginx. This measure is taken to ensure that even if the
application crashes or takes on too much traffic the website
will still serve properly.
</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>I can sleep soundly at night knowing I have saved teenagers
from having to fill out a few more forms in their lives.
I hope my work improves the management, organization, 
and success of the National Honor Society of Northwest
Pennsylvania Collegiate Academy.</p></div></div></div><div class="projects section"><div class="major-projects"><div class="container"><h2>Apps</h2></div><a href="/projects/subtweet/" class="project"><div class="container"><div class="document document-left"><h3>Subtweet</h3><p>The solution to Twitter DMs, Subtweet extends Twitter's
